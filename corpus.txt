Let me tell you what I think about frog spit
I'm for it
In the sunny months, it's the only thing I trust
And the naked lady shoots me with the fish
I wanna fall back
I want to fall back
The best part of all is there's nothing square about it
Let me tell you what I​ think about turtle spit
It's on my lip, it's on my tongue, there's nothing wrong
Smile politely to please the lady with the fish
I want to fall back
I bought you a corsage
And pinned a flower on my jacket
Because this night means a lot to me
Then you went
And spilled punch
All on my tuxedo shirt
White as a cloud
And now I'm screaming out loud
Oh man, it's taking me over
Oh man, it's taking me over
I found another four leaf clover
Up there on the mountain peak
Where it was hard to speak about...
And the only thing that would come out
And the only thing that would come out was..
Oh man, it's taking me over
Oh man, it's taking me over
Haiku-Like
Imagination
Big bright buddha adjust
The station
I'm at this party
Gutty-what's moving to
The electric avenue
Let's engage in an
Ongoing conversation
Hopping from topic to topic
From the tropic of cancer to recess and bitches
My work's always coming home with me
More dirty dishes
More baby kittens
And sucker punches
Johnny, Johnny get on with your life
Won't get a chance, to get on with it twice
So if fucking up feels right
Then fuck it up
Spread love and you're less likely
To step in shit when you're retracing
Share what people show you
Johnny, Johnny get on with your life
Won't get a chance, to get on with it twice
So if fucking up feels right
Then fuck it up
Spread love and you're less likely
To step in shit when you're retracing

Who's that skinny boy with his chin on his collar trying not to exist?
He has no friends to dance with
Inside the kids all shuffle wearing skin
Outside, waiting, a lonely skeleton
For his mom to pick him up and take him home and end the looks
Until he's safe in bed
To worry about his bones
Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in
But at least I'll never be stuck inside my skin
They're not like me
I'm not like them
But surely
There must be
A place where skeletons
Can dance with other skeletons
Let's just forget everything said
And everything we did
Best friends and better halves
Goodbyes
And the autumn night when we realized
We were falling out of love
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said that weren't meant
There were some things that were said)
But we never did
Not to be
Overly (overly) dramatic
I just think it's best
'Cause you can't miss what you forget
So, let's just pretend everything
And anything between you and me
Was never meant
Was never meant
I'm thinking about leaving
And how I should say goodbye
With a handshake
Or an embrace
Or a kiss on the cheek
Possibly all three
Well, maybe I've been wrong
Maybe my intentions are irrelevant
But honestly, it's not just for me
We've both been so unhappy
So, let's just see what happens
When the summer ends
Honestly I can't remember teen dreams
All my teenage feelings and the meanings
They seemed too see-through
To be true
All the who's are there
But the why's (But the why's)
The why's are unclear
(Are unclear)

Picture this
The long awaited sickening kiss
How does it feel (Explain)
To know (How)
We've re-written history
(These things change)
Despite the complicated
Beginning to all of this
Honestly?
Sensitivity deprived
I can't feel a thing inside
I blamed my father in my youth
Now as a father, I blame the booze
I have become uncomfortably numb

Whose ugly side is the ugliest?
Sensitivity deprived
All my sympathy prescribed
Whose hands are tied to a contortionist?
I used to struggle in my youth
Now I'm used to struggling for two
I have become uncomfortably numb

The lessons
The lessons
Are so much
Are so much
Less obvious
The further you get from home
The further I get from home
How will you exist
How will I exist
Without consequence?
I'll let you know

We were gentle to begin
When I pushed you around to break you in
Now whenever I try to be clear with you
I only end up feeling see-through
I've tried, but you've won
Comatose, like father like son

The lessons
The lessons
Are so much
Are so much
Less obvious
The further you get from home
The further I get from home
How will you exist
How will I exist?
I don't want to know
Blacked out, redacted
I just want you home
I'll make new friends in the ambulance
Don't leave home, again
If empathy takes energy
'Cause everyone feels just like you
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
So physical
But that's life, it's so so-so
So emotional
So, stay home
Tonight will be the night
I'm going to make this right
I ran out the door so fast
They thought I wouldn't come back;
Back to the same three days
Over and over again
Fraction of zero sum
Ad infinitum:
All the regret I keep
All the mistakes I dread
Exhausted from oversleep
Awake but still in bed
Ashamed of the things I've said
Afraid of what's in my head
So under this bridge I'll stay
And wait for the same three days to end
I sob when I speak
They're looking at me
But I can't tell what they see
My thoughts slow to a crawl
I embrace the fall
So I won't answer your calls
It wasn't always this way:
Perpetually in the gray
Solace in empty fate
The years evaporate
But within the harsh spotlight
I bury myself inside
'Cause every time that I think
I let you go
They will construct this maze
Of fear that I navigate
I'll attempt to parse my place
You'll define everything
I'll finally shut my mouth
Feel both my feet touch ground
Put an end to this run
Just say the word and I'll jump
"To everyone: Yeah, you were right
I'll never get better and I'm sorry
Next time, I won't sob when I speak
I'll be at peace because it's not 'want,' it's 'need'
Ooh ooh ooh oooohh
Ooh ooh ooh oooohh
Ooh ooh ooh oooohh
Ooh ooh ooh I
And I
And I
And I
Need to be someone else"
I couldn't get my life back
I couldn't get my life back, I couldn't save myself
All the words of my mother hang heavy over me
It's summer in Texas, 2003
I dissociate, the world around me fades
There is no self if there is no one else
So I isolate and suppress discomfort
And I sacrifice any shred of my own self-worth
While I put so much faith in my open eyes
I have never felt so lonely and desperate
I couldn't get my life back
I couldn't get my life back, I didn't stand a chance
All the pain within my past weighs heavy on my heart
The euphoria won't last, it'll tear your life apart
I feel the same; the world around me changed
It is a mess, and I could not make sense
Of this brave new world I navigate alone
Or my hyper-vulnerability I now call home
'Cause I put so much trust in their shifting words
And I have never felt so stupid and useless before
But it is all my fault
I never should have trusted them
It's easy to smile and wave, to tell them one thing to their face
It's hard to tell the truth
Yeah, it is all my fault
But how could I have known that
What people call low self-esteem is really just seeing yourself
The way other people see you?
I couldn't get my life back
I couldn't get my life back
I couldn't get my life back
I couldn't get my life back
They broke the foundation
Removed the blindfold
And pushed me far
The weight of the world falls
Into the laps of
The ones who made me this way
We play this game
And shift the blame
And change its name
To "keep one another
Keep one another
Keep one another
Safe"
And "keep one another
Keep one another
Keep one another
Safe"
We swallow pride
Our doors blown wide
And now we're waiting by the hour
We rip and tear
Ourselves apart and
And then we're stripped of any context
But why?
The same rules apply:
If you think you're fine, I won't call it a lie
But where's that leave us?
Who've done all we can?
Wrecked our lives to reach a goal we weren't built for
And now we're slowly healing?
We're slowly healing
We're slowly healing
And we're slowly healing
We're slowly healing
We're slowly healing
To "keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Safe"
To "keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Keep one another (We're slowly healing)
Safe"
We stumble into our dirty bedroom
Unload and undress, collapse into bed
Brushing away the past from our shoulders;
Another night, another day older
We discard our regrets and sleep in our secrets
You realize you don't know how to tell me the truth
And I accept it: I am never happy to see you
We wake up early every day for weeks
Drive for long hours, take three person showers
You're counting the days till you see him again
Another night, another day spent
Shutting my mouth tight, looking on the bright side
We knew from the start this would crush both of our hearts
But what can I say? We did it anyway
But it is okay, we figured things would end up this way
And it is okay, I know I'll stop breathing one day
And I'll never be able to justify
The ways that I lived my only life
I just want something to feel all right
Something to show for all this time
How many times will I pour my heart into
Another person's failure to move?
How many times can we give this a try?
How many nights will I lie awake waiting?
I tried to be someone else to escape it all
It became an obsession, and I awoke in a world divorced from self;
A false reimagining of which I am the subject
Shrouded in abstract conceptual intangibles
I know that I'm broken, and I play the part
Why try to get better? I was born to tear myself apart
This lifelong dissonance, how could it mean nothing?
I become a concept inside of myself
All the failures of our fathers can't define us
If all that weight fell on our shoulders, who could blame us?
I felt locked in a stigma beyond my control
And in my vulnerability, I am fed their words and I swallow them whole
Promised a way out, and I sign a contract
A widespread mandate to suppress doubt
And push it all inside: my endlessly lost heart
And raging mind, just keep it all inside
But the shame and trauma, how could it mean nothing?
It lives inside of me, rebuilds and restarts
All the failures of our fathers can't define us
If all that weight fell on our shoulders, who could blame us?
Our anxieties and fears can't control us
If all their thoughts fall on deaf ears
I erase these memories, and I try
To reconstruct myself to fit into this life
You might want to be someone else
But what good would that do though?
You might want to be someone else
But what good would that do though?
But what good would that do though?
If all this weight falls on your shoulders?
You're not listening, I said "stop"

Because it's come to be too much
I can't just pile aesthetic-perceptive dilemma
Over-analytic demeanors, feelings of lonely worthlessness
And unproductivity atop the other
Allowing each to bleed through their fabricated boundaries
And become one more thing to...

Notice me
Before it's too late and too far away
From when I dreamt of explaining to you
That you are an everywhere
That caused these words I'd somehow type
My fingers, feet and diaphragm
All screaming

And as things grew more complicated
Conscious expansion cultivated
The books' ideas, songs' polyphony
Texture, content danced around me
And unlike all the events staged
The puppeteered facade I'd made
This was naturally extraordinary
And grabbed me from the ordinary
Now perceived reduction theory
Of where we are

From afar
It made less sense and appeared
Beautyless, which I guess is its defense
Not that any simple allegory transcends
My inability
To relate, it's this ability to relate that
Provides the socially obligatory things that I
Want to re-learn
Why we're friends again
I thought you knew

I can pile one atop the other, it just feels bad
It just feels bad to realize
You might hear something
In the quietest of nights

There are two of me and
One of them will say "Hannah"
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now

"So now, a relationship that was totally meaningless and trivial is over. It's hard to get too upset"
Placed behind door number 3
I lay shaking, will he pick me?
Don't be alarmed or misinterpret
For it's his anonymity that put me here
I should decide whether it's
The dopamine or someone hitting "refresh" on my

Spinal
Chord is aching as if the earth
Like me
Been shaking, shaken up

Door number 3 has opened up
And like that, the world pounces on the knobs of one and two
"If we can't have it all, then why have anything at all?"
They chant
Their song sending shivers up and down, around my

Spinal
Chord is aching as if the earth
Like me
Been shaking, shaken
Up and
Into the place we know will give the
Verdict
Then finding that there's something in the
Something in the
Something in the water

But I can't seem to put my glass down
Maybe because soon I'll be inside
Drowning in it's confines
Pounding on the glass like I were five

I can't remember what it was I felt
Or heard, or saw, or touched after hearing the word "hello"
Dancing figures intimate, I know
But there was more involved that made me believe
That there were two of them and only one of me

It gets harder to see them as the water rises, as I criticize it
It's his eye, it
Fills the glass, it's all that I could ask
For he is drowning in the same room as me
And it's the very thing that makes me believe
That there are two of him and only one of me

Let me bathe amidst my ignorance, ignorance
As if I were asleep
As if I were asleep
Just shut up and swallow before your last breath
You'll say what's to be said
Well my last breath breathed, leaked last night
As he melted into walls
That spoke like the sun to the last man and woman on the earth
"We will both die nice and warm"

Warm is what it is to see
His insides on the floor
Of an abandoned auditorium
Singing in polyphony

"Just shut up and swallow" is what the kid meant
When he complained about all of it
The ease of an important procedure and how everyone everywhere was always, mostly often laying down on him, maiming, crushing, killing him
But I bought none of it! This is not universal
Kid is not he who abandoned that auditorium and no, I do not want to become him anymore, but yes, I do want him to become what I believe he once was, my best friend, and stop that, he still is
I don't really think about it that way, no, I don't really ever think about it that way
"Is your brain big enough to get your feelings hurt? Me neither!"
Well, me neither!

I think I'll leave this place now
Go to summer where the sun won't go down
I'll gladly leave this place now
Wonderful the days would seem away from here

"You hate everyone; to you everyone's either a moron, or a creep, or a poser. Why do you suddenly care about their opinion of you?"
"Because I'm shallow, okay! I want them to like me."
"Just shut up and swallow" I thought they all said
So I complained about all of it, but now
I think I'll leave this place now
I think I'm the same
Now we're the same
Hat of greens shows symmetry
In front of hat, alone, sits me
Fourth day
I don't want it anyway to be reliving
It won't be that bad again because
It can't amount in comparison

(I should intimidate you as you should intimidate yourself!)

Thirty minutes of make-up
For all to see but you
Are not what I want you to be
Universal there
At three AM on the first of a year
When it started, I'm not sure
In a jumper, with a bracelet
In a jumper, with a bracelet
On your right wrist
That turns with a golden knob
Opening amidst a dense yellow light, fade
To reveal an infinite sky

(And juxtaposed to the accelerating swell of the musical score pushes it's audience to realize just what is ahead, the characters' fear and the physical manifestation of their hopes and dreams coming closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and
Kiss me!)

My dad says things that make me laugh
He meows Tom Petty songs and that's why I stay
Unlike running water, can't run away
There are more here than merely bodies
Things without fear of surrounding me
Branches to catch me falling
Perhaps someone who understands

That when I say I'm sad I mean it
That there is no excuse, I need this
What I said about hat of greens
Has led me to see that my superimposition of a face
Upon a poster on it's way
Arriving any day, that will accompany me every night
In a welcoming of rest
Tacked onto the drywall surrounding me
Will probably return me to this fading
The sky being a bedroom
Kiss me
But I don't want to
Night slows me down and puts me off
Totter-scatter-blabbering
Sort of funny that you would make a
Stop-action short

Because I sort of pretend that I'm next to your progressing form
As you move from shot to shot
I mean, I'm next to you on the streets
Of a city that I never really thought I'd move in to
That I never even really saw myself moving in
But now, I'm in the way of this other me
That's just trying to say
"Sort of funny that you're moving on along
These streets you happen to now live on!"

It's these ideas that waste all my time!
It's these ideas that waste all my time!
It's these ideas that waste all my time!
It's these ideas that waste all my time!

Okay, okay, okay, so honesty didn't do anything
For me once again
But it did the night that I said to Rob
That I could not keep my opinions to myself for any longer
But that could've just been another one of my
Another one of my...
Blah! Blah Blahs!
Hey

Hey coffee eyes
You got me coughing up my cookie heart
Making promises to myself
Promises like seeds
Of everything I could be

Hey
Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises too loosely
In a haste to lose me
And I've given all I could give
We live in quick flips, slips, tips, and taps
To snap us outta these statue traps
But I've taken all I could take

Hey
Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises like Bruce Lee
In a haste to bruise me
And I've given all I could give
I've taken all I could take
I've pushed all that I could push
I've pulled all that I could pull

Kitty kitty cat, skinny kitty cat

Fire is motion
Work is repetition
This is my document
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all defenses
Fire is motion, is motion growth?

And you are colder
Than oldness could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs
And you are colder
Than oldness could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs

My mama, my my mama said
My cousin bucky's so boldly bald
My cousin bucky never took his hat off
He always kept his hair back
My cousin bucky kept his hair back
He kept that cap on
Even when swimming
Yeah, I know there's a lesson
In there somewhere
Something nothing
Special about boys
Who smell like salami
And boys who've never apologized

And you are colder
Than oldness could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs
We're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
We're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
We're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
I am a puppy, a balloon, and a happy accident
Missed she teaching me myths mistold
Hold me here dearest and turn me gold
And I watched you holding up the sun
I remember her saying
"This whole world is a waste of my time"
All I could say is
"I wish I had something to say"
If we stand still long enough
The sun will move around us
You can't look at the sky without looking right through it
Mud. Muddy slush. Slushy lawn
In the in-between of the Winter and Spring and the lawn's long gone
People walking, lotsa people walking over the life in the mud on the sidewalk under my crawl
Mud bubbles pop and burst breath into the air
Where's the inbetween if everyone's a me
That there tree grew outta me
People talking, lotsa people talking
I'm hurt, you're hurt, my dad's hurt and haven't you learned everyone's hurt
Sure, we're all smiles seeing reptiles and birds in bars
We measure up each species in our heads
Barely aware that we're so scared we measure up each species in our heads
I can step on that li'l fucker's jaw
I can snap him in half like a wishbone
And I think to myself (like I'm always thinking)
I want everything and two of some of this shit
Find my place in the ape house
See myself in their eyes
My fingers on their feet
My possessive love somewhere in their embrace
My freedom's limitations in their swinging and hollering
I'm singing, I'm hollering
I'm singing, I'm hollering
I'm always bothering
When I fly and look down
I'd swear that's not me
That's not me
Forget your taught talking and lessening lessons
You strut like a stutter
Dumb loser user boy so used to the abuse
Can't see how he's been used
Pokes me in the side
Mistakes my gagging for a smile
I can't fly till he can fly
City lights graced interstates
The way you move your hands
Through your hair when you feel alone
Through your hair when you feel alone
Remember the flowers you picked
When we crossed over Madison?
You were so sure you found yourself
That you branded it into an oak
The one you swore reached through the sky
And swallowed the city line
You had yet to hit twenty-three
An age that would swallow you
Then, every breath made you confess
You did not know what to do with your hands
This is a new side of you
So full of fear
Oh no! I thought you'd changed
Take back all the things you said
I remember thinking this evidence
You left was damning enough
But you took all the words from my mouth and pulled them out
How could I not see you for what you are?
But you turned all the words from my mouth into doubt
And I wish I could tear your heart out!
Break meter and release, and still the voice it keeps
And I wish that your lungs would give out
And finally give air to breathe
But I know better now
No words can weed you out
When your back's against the wall
You'll be crying out
I'll take all the words from your mouth and leave them out
And your hands are shaking
Finally, call out!
And the silence breaks your heart finally
Oh, I almost pity you now
(I almost pity you now)
Finally, call out!
Oh, I almost pity you now
And I wish I could tear your heart out!
Break meter and release
And still the voice that keeps
And I wish for you lungs to give out
Finally
Will all my twenties find me so guarded?
Lettered and documented by meticulous word choice and closed lips
To read like:
All things bear this-
A purpose! or romance!
But the truth is much more complicated than that
And i am still trying to learn how time is a gift
(as much as it is a burden)
You settled into uneasy sleep, a subtle hint that things were changing
And every breath of labored rest brought new designs of old regrets
And how they aged you! How they took your strength away!
(When they entered your body and pinned fear to weight)
Pull out! Pull out!
Lead your weak cells to oxygen, and sew your skin to bone
You can hold on! Hold on!
Lend dead weight to stronger hands
You are not alone
(You are not alone)
If you're weighed down, I'll lay your fears to rest
You are safe now
(You are safe now)
He long days piled into weeks before you'd speak, as the storm crawled to meet the shoreline. And it began to rain at once!
I tried (I tried, I tried, I tried) to keep the awful things at bay from you
But it was on the air and useless
I might as well have tried to prove the words I fought to purchase would comfort you
Like, "there was nothing more that we could do."
Or that I still loved you (when nothing could be further from the truth)
Will your hand fall out of mine?
Your shame lives on its own, trying to reach the depths down where it belongs
Will it find rest in your bones?
Aching and pulling muscles to act out against you!
So stay your pity now
If it reaches the heart, we all pull out
And let the beat slow down
(There's nothing that we can do you for now)
Are you sorry or are you just scared?
There will be no false comfort here
Oh, I ought to tell you the truth! I did not come to plea for you
Where was your heart when your words led the truth anywhere else from you?
You're not sorry, you are just scared
I have not come to calm your fears
I am sorry I hid what you are
But everyone else but me already knew! already knew!
And would not come to plea for you
Where was your heart when they never appeared?
Anyone else would care
But you would not shoulder the weight you should bear
I will not shed a single tear
"So while you're fixing up your bed
So while you’re organizing drawers
Could you just listen to the problems had
With problems of yours?
And what’s that note you’re writing there?
Why are you giving me this back?
This was a gift from when we met
Back when you weren’t so upset"

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable
I couldn’t recognize your shell

Your branching off had met an end
From all the weight that made you bend
And when you tried to shed your leaves
You pined for warmth as they said
“Your lack of love for your dear self
Is sapping all of us here out!
Trace your roots back to the ground
Work out the knotholes for yourself”

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your family made me feel responsible
And I found the notes you left behind
Little hints and helpless cries
Desperate wishing to be over

You said you’re trapped in your body
And getting deeper every day
They diagnosed you born that way
They say it runs in your family
A conscious erasure of working class background
Where despair trickles down
Imbalanced chemical crutch
Open up, swallow down
You said “Remember me for me
I need to set my spirit free”

I called in sick from your funeral
(I called in sick, I called in sick)
Tradition of closure nearly felt impossible
(I called in sick, I called in sick)
I should have never gave my word to you
Not a cry, not a sound
Might have learned how to swim
But never taught how to drown
You said “Remember me for me"
I watched you set your spirit free
Open the curtains
Singing birds tell me
"Tear the buildings down."
You felt blessed
To receive their pleasant sound
Of things that break
Make you cringe
Inside yourself there's a child
Counting stars in their time-out
Of their day
In the corners of their frame
They are encased
In the losing of a grain
Of themselves
Pushed against the ebb and flow
Wave good-bye and watch it go
Well show me the honest, proper way
To disarm predatory gaze
Sucking dry
Never satiated
You've been misused
Been rewired
You're short-circuiting now
Just remember when
You'd call me to come
Take a deep breath, and then jump
So fragile are bodies
So concave, work in
Self-destructive ways
Shot from the hip and missed
Detaching from all of this
In physical pictures you remain
Spiral 'round yourself in figure-eight
I recoil at every new beginning
I searched for a way out
Don't we all?
Existentialist recall:
Turn in all dichotomies and
Truths that I gave
I felt wrong in many ways
Didn't heal
Just got harder every day
To be still
To be passing
Through the throes
In a daze
Feeling heavy
Feeling cold in my skin
In my hand-me-downs
Wearing everything thin
And the pills
That you gave didn't do anything
I just slept for years on end
(Fuck!)

So if I call
Should I beg?
Because I'm desperate here;
A couple steps from the edge
I can't seem to burn bright enough
I'm cold and I'm left alone
We're all alone
Grab a hold
I know I said to not
What the fuck do I know?
I had a chance
To construct
Something beautiful
And I choked
You were born on a leap year
Fill in the gaps
Spinning gears keep catching your cracks
Skipping teeth
Keep calling you back
Telling stories pretending they’re fact
Let me go. Too unstable to wane
Chewing wildflowers to numb the pain
Cut the lines. You’ll be fine
But if you break when I break, will you carry me away?
Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I’m saying I can’t?
You came out. Started bruising
Find it tough to admit when your losing
Oh, what should i think?
Carefully crafted commercial disaster
They take what you’re after to get what they want out of you
Dissociate from touch
You’re tilting to pull the others with you
Posed shakespearean skull, we see in different pictures
You play the imperial
Stealing the power to waste away
You took the comfort from the lights in her soul
Projected map of the body:
It's crass, abject, colonial
You passed disease presented to you at birth
Held underwater told to scream your self worth
It wasn’t good enough
Entrust the secrets to the backs of your arms
Killing the self as to protect it from harm
"What would you do if someone hurt your best friend's feelings to the point where they become insane?"
"I would say something that made them stop, or I would just text him and try not to let the bully touch them, just try to block them from doing that. If I got punched, that's okay because, it's not okay because, I would try and get the other person safe, cause I was only in the middle of it. But I would try and help somebody not get hurt"
You cut your ties, felt better off
Salutations to your son
Awoke to find you heading out
With your white collar undone
You placed a bar, I played a game
To see how low that I could go
We develop mental pictures
And we’re following our fathers down the drain
Do you recall the imagery from when I drove you away?
Through others’ rose prescription lens
Man I’m sorry every day
Because we intersect internally
And then we take what we have and we run
And It all starts to unravel
Until we’re less than we were carrying before
I guess I expected more
Wake me, wake me up
Pictures of you smiling in times
When I just couldn’t be around
Hold me, hold me up
Count my rings to see how many winters
I’ve been stuck here under ground
Swore I’d not burn out
Digging through the memories
That made you feel alive when you were young
You were right to doubt
Broken since foundations
In the structures you were building came undone
Part of your charm was
The way you would push me from
All of the traps that I just couldn’t see
Figures the one that was there to
Have tripped you up
Would be the one
That was set there by me
Wish I was there to say goodbye when you went away
Wish I was home but noplace was there
I cut off my arm at the bone in solidarity
Capital teaches that there’s less when you share
I felt the noose tighten up on your collar bone
I felt the gun in the small of your back
Engraved in the stone
By request and recurse of friends dead is
“Tell me again that it’s all in my head.”
Well we called off your guard as we entered the yard
To convince you to redirect some of that rage
Because who fed you rocks while they ate their thanksgiving
And who left you out all alone in their cage
And when you were a pup, well I watched you so close
You ran straight to the distance allowed by his post
You got kicked, you got choked, phrases crept up your spine
When he said "we must keep our bitches in line"
And on his poker nights he says the same of his wife
He's the top dog/pack leader/true alpha-male
So make no sudden moves keep your nose from the border
You move fast. You eat last this side of pecking-order
So why don't you come with me?
We've got acres with streams. We won't keep you in cages/make you beg for your treats. We won't tell you to heel, though you might need some time to
Dig up those old bones your young self left behind
You said
"Your offer is nice but here should suffice
Yeah, my younger years were something but that isn't my life
Master is all that I've got
He keeps me having a purpose
Gives me bed, keeps me fed
And I'm just slightly nervous of what I might do
If I were let loose
If I caught that mail car
Or ate garbage for food
So, as I bare all my teeth
I will ask of you please to just leave."
Well your heart has spoken
I feel you're already house broken
Well I made you a hood ornament for an oncoming car
Because your bark might seem bad but I'll show you the scars
From when the state sent you over to deliver your teeth
To the heels of your kindred breaking chains from their feet
And then you wipe your hands clean. Splash of water/paper napkin
While the parrots sing headlines, we wear the leash like a fashion
Try to take out my claws expect a visceral reaction
Try to muzzle me up, I'll lash out, I'll bite back and
Keep my options open
For fear of becoming housebroken
Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Sincerity
Trust in me
Throw myself
Into your door

(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)

Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Ooh, I dream
To heal your wounds
But I bleed myself
Well, I bleed myself

(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)

Circles
In Circles

(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)
Sew it on
Face the fool
December's tragic drive
When time is poetry
And stolen the world outside
The waiting could crush my heart

Sew it on
Face the fool
The tide breaks, a wave of fear
And brave songs disappear
To the secret voice of dawn
This last time raise my eyes

You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
The right words in time
The right words

Sew it on
Face the fool
The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes
Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflected in savage shards
A new face, a soul reborn

You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
The right words in time
The right words
So I say, still awake
Sleep, close my eyes
An image of your face
Traced in white sand
Underneath, undefined
I lay down
Arms outstretched
I embrace the fall
And all the time
I tried to let you know
Discomfort comes clearly

(Whoa X5)
Sometimes, you see right through me
Words
Words

(You're married to that)
(You're married to that)
Although you hit me hard, I come back
(You're married to your pain)
The earth cries
(You're married to that)
When I call
(You're married to that)
On the inside
(You're married to your pain)
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Run behind
Which one will I...?

Thin comfort
In what I say
My back is turned
I halo my soul
For a while
And all the time
I tried
To let you know
Discomfort
Comes clearly
When I’ll shout


(You're married to that)
(You're married to that)
Although you hit me hard, I come back
(You're married to your pain)
The earth cries
(You're married to that)
When I fall
(You're married to that)
On the inside
(You're married to your pain)
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Run behind
Which one will I...?
But you were always one to stay the same, girl
I know you want to be the rain
And I know that we would fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I'll take you burying old bones
Dawn's grey, the sign in the winter light
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

But I was one to play the fool, girl
Though rules were somewhat dark to me
And I know that we could fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I give you darium bound stones
Grow through the roots of your mind set apart
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

Total anxiety, pay for variety
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to turn

The world we sold, there was a choir there
The world we sold, there was a choir there
Disgrace for you

Don't tell me you've gone astray
I talk in circles
Everlasting chains that bind my purpose
Only I've seen million things that tell me so

Total anxiety, pay for variety
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to...
Choked on society, laced with cyanide
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to turn
I lost myself when I looked in your eyes
I tried to disguise myself
Fear inside
Fear inside my love
The suffering moved and breathed
Our hands silhouettes
Against the sky
Against the sky our love

Where were you?
Hope to chain this memory
We could have been the last time
Show me the sight of the side of chance
Hold tomorrow one foot in and one foot out
Are you strong enough?
Are you strong enough, pitiful boy?

I lost myself in your embrace
I saw the lie come clear
Fear inside
Fear inside our love
Fallen now run away
Tried to reveal myself
Fear inside
The lights you make
Ease the babies out of their wombs
Make your hair blonde, hop on the number four
Do you become the driver when they drop you off?
I'll become the driver
You don’t take their money, ripping out their roots
They found two heads hollowed out
In the sanctuary or on the dry roadside
This is a duel and she won
Congratulate her, send her thanks
"How great that someone's doing
What many of us should have done"
Put up a statue of the new killer
Out of chains in the waxing moon
Do you see my shadow off the stake?
Are you Diana, the Hunter?
Are you Diana, the Hunter?
Are you afraid of me now?
Well, yeah. Shouldn’t I be?
But don’t you quiver
I am an instrument
I am revenge
I am several women
Follow the arrow from behind the line
Moving forward, the night begins
We are brave and strong, but you don’t quiver
Let’s write this down together
Our hands on the same weapon
Make evil afraid of evil’s shadow
Make evil afraid of evil’s shadow
Make evil afraid of evil’s shadow
Whenever you find home
And if everyone belongs there
Feeling our bodies breaking down
Just trying to find a way out to a city so big
That it is bound to keep your secrets
Pack your seats high
Saying goodbye to your close friends
Making some promises like
“I’ll see you again”
So when will I see you again?
(new apartment complexes rising)
I know a few chords that could make you miss me
They ring and decay in this garage every few days
Just trying to figure out this beat
So if you want to come back East
Then maybe you can help me find it
(take down your pictures, pack your belongings)
If your arms are just felt
When you hold me, I’ll feel held
We’ll sink in these notes
It never felt like this
It never felt like this
Tell me we belong here
If your arms become smoke
Then I’ll have nothing left to hold
We’ll dissipate with these notes
It shouldn’t feel like this
It shouldn’t feel like this
If everyone belongs here
We are the walls in formless shapes
The overbearing weight
This house weighs heavy on my mind
Erasing tapes, undocumented faiths
Took down your pictures and your belongings
In boxes buried under the soil, in the yard behind our tree, you’ll wait
Wrote tiny poems through the lines of my hands
Little birds flew by me
The wind’s been calling your name South in pursuit of foreign lands
Can’t go back
Where’s your tact?
Where’s your grace?
Where are the things you replace?
Are our words more than sound?
We cut the air and we’ve found to lose your faith in the world is to lose faith in yourself
We are ghosts in our homes
We travel under the floor
And when our voices fail us, we will find new ways to sing
And when our bodies fail, we’ll find joy in the peace that it brings
And when our voices fail us, we will find new ways to sing

The world is a beautiful place but we have to make it that way
Whenever you find home, we’ll make it more than just a shelter
And if everyone belongs there, it will hold us all together
If you’re afraid to die, then so am I
There's tiny worlds inside your mind
Your fingers are a distant sky
You shove into your mouth
To block the whole sun out
It's better than living in the light
To die overexposed, so you fight and that's alright
You're harmless in your mind
You're formless in the night
And that's alright
What do you think is going right in your life?
What can you know about life if you've never died?
You think that the world is alright but that's a lie
'Cos we're afraid to die and that's alright
Where is the action?
Where are the streets that take you to bed?
What is your name and what do you do here?
We have the same thoughts clouding our heads
Formless shapes in the darkness
We are as harmless as the thoughts in our heads
Drinking poison and chewing on concrete
Burning holes in the sheets on our beds
We think that the world is alright
We think that the world is alright and that's a lie
I was a child
It’s a strange thought
Where is it going?
In the trees it looks like bees to float around like that;
Like part of the rest of the thing, not looking for entertainment
Don’t worry if what you say is a quote from older days
When in doubt, just look it up
Or when in real doubt, look around you and stop crying
Stop crying

Better to let them know sooner than later
Like you’ve never rolled down a window in your whole life
Do you remember the start, where it all came down?
We aren’t looking for entertainment to forgive your parents
You are normal and healthy to forgive yourself
I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I’ll give you the time
If you at least call
I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I feel like a child
Who is running in circles
Screaming his head off
I want to smash things
I want a coffee
I want to punch myself repeatedly
Let's watch a movie
Expend no energy
And just be
Can we just be
I want to smash things
I want a coffee
Can we just be
Can we just be
Decompressing
Will you let me
I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I just don't understand why you're there
Without me
I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I just don't understand why you're there
Without me
I've called off the search
I know exactly where you are
I feel like a child
Who is running in circles
Screaming his head off
I'm not so upset now
Deep into this picture
Distorted surroundings
With alternate endings
Reality's bending
I feel stuck between
What's real and what's not
Different words and different thoughts
Live in daydreams
I choose fiction
I feel exhausted
I feel exhausted
Get away
From this big screen I'd get away
Get away
From this bright screen I'd get away
From this big scene
From this bright screen
I want to smash things
I want a coffee
Can I just be
Can I just be
I want to smash things
Walk around deceivingly
Can I just be
Get away
From this big screen
Get away
From this big scene
Make this and reshape it
Pictures of some cute girls’ faces
Some sort of stupid inspiration
While we’re running, running down
Graze until the grass is brown, then just leave it
Spilled my guts from my chest
It’s like there’s less and less left
You know I really want to
Be unconditioned
You know I really want to
Turn & go & turn
You know I really want to
Be completely different
You know I really want to
Really know it all
Reshape and erase this
Funny people, funny places
It’s boring everything is shapeless
While we’re running, running down
Hey, I've got bigger fish to fry
They're swordfish sized
They're swimming small circles
And asking for a break
Hey, I've got bigger fish to fry
So don't hold out for me to try
And find the time
I don't care if you can't understand the why's
Hey, I've got bigger fish to fry
They're swordfish sized
Hey, I've got bigger fish to fry
Working on lots of things, all tucked away
Hiding from my phone
I never thought I'd quit complaining
I thought I had time to be alone
And I've got all these fish to fry
And I've got all these fish to fry
I just need a little time
I drifted out
On a cruise ship
Into the ocean
I'm stuck here now
In this stupid compartment
Drifted out
Far from things I care about
If I could please lay down
The air the air the air
I'm reaching for the air
Mother nature's disappeared
Anyone? I'm here
We’re here
Reached another stage that we can't talk about
Find the keys to something and let it out
Forced to be here so we can brag about
The different things we’ve seen
The different things we’ve tried
Reached another stage to talk about
The consequences we can live without
Perverse enjoyment when I drag you down
The way we live the way we let it out
If I could please lay down
Am I the only one
To ever let you down?
I'm not the only one
That you can't live without
Am I the only one
You ever think about?
I believe that
You're deceiving
And it feels like
I don't feel right
I believe that
The world is leaning
It's slightly shifted
Breathing, repeating
One achievement
And you've conceded:
Defeat's your own choice
The future deleted
Plain Information
Laced with opinion
Sports game showdown
World war conspiracy
Pirates highjack friendly ships on the open seas
Students writing papers & finishing homework early
I wanna go
I wanna know
And understand the basic concept of
Human completeness
I wanna go
I wanna know
How to feel like everyone does
How to see like everyone else does
Walk, run, walk again
Approach the positive end
Slow down, think it out
Be careful what's described as instinct
Learned behavior, and cultural bias
Walk, run, walk again
Approach the opposite end
Slow down, think it out
Locked inside but alive
Trained and tooled to survive
Abdication and how to deal with
Wild living and wild life
Students writing papers and finishing
Homework early
I wanna go
I wanna know
And understand the basic concept of
Human completeness
I wanna go
I wanna know
How to feel like everyone does
How to see like everyone else does
Tell me you never wanna see me again
And then keep showing up at my house
Tell me you'll never be in love again
Now you're walking round with someone else
If I was hungry then you were starving
And he was so sick but you were dying
If I was hungry then you were starving
Now tell the dead man that you're the one dying
Treat them like queens until they disagree
And never reflect to think 'wait, maybe the problem was me'
Nah, man, just keep smoking weed
Tell this one 'yeah they were all crazy, unlike you baby.'
Tell me that no one knows me like you do
And tell me that my friends don't tell me the truth
And maybe I'll come crawling back to you
Like, that was your plan, right?
You worked so hard but we were 'just lucky'
To ride those coat tails into infinity
And all my success has got nothing to do with me
Yeah, tell me again how there just aren't that many girls in the music scene
It's another all-male tour preaching equality
It's another straight cis man who knows more about this than me
It's another man telling us we're missing a frequency, show 'em Kelly
It's another man telling us we can't fill up the room
It's another man telling us to book a smaller venue
'Nah, hey, cmon girls we're only thinking about you'
Well, see how far we've come not listening to you
"Yeah, just get a female opener, that'll fill the quota."
“I’m not gonna climb
A ladder for the rest of my life”
You said that and stood back
And you walked away before they could react
Hearing cat calls from police cars
And they say
“What you gonna do about it dressed the way you are?”
Yeah, it’s a very common lie
They say you're asking for it
When you’re walking home alone at night

They say the only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they scare in you
The only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you

So, you turned and walked away
Forgot everything they taught you ’til that day
And started arguing eloquently
As to whether jet fuel could melt steel beams
Hearing cat calls from a construction yard
They’ll say, “Take it as a compliment, they’re only being nice”
Yeah, it’s a far too common lie
And you’ll carry keys between your knuckles
When you walk alone at night

They say the only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they sell to you
The only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you

It’s the trophy wives raising trophy wives
Raising children on TV
Scared of people like you and me
Just don’t ask questions, you’ll sleep peacefully
We will not go out in silence
And we will not go quietly
Nah, jet fuel can’t melt steel beams
I’ve watched enough
Conspiracy documentaries, yeah

They say the only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you
The only thing that stops
A bad man with a gun
Is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you
Use to control you
I had to leave because
I had to say no and stop
More than once
Way too many times
And you just kept trying to change my mind

So I left, it was 3am
And I slept in the middle of my bed
With the comfort of my own choices
Yeah I bet you didn't even think about what you did

Could it be true?
You don't seem like that kind of guy
Not you, you've got that one song that I like
They said he's got one song that I like

Now I don't even know why I went
Every light on the way was screaming at me 'red'
Now you've got me questioning everything I did
Or what would've happened if I'd done one thing different

And I saw it, the face of god
And he turned himself away from me
And said I did something wrong
That somehow what happened to me was my fault
You can see it in apologists and hear it in the songs

Could it be true?
You couldn't do that to someone
Not you, nah your music is too good
They said your music is too good
Kept saying your music is too good
They said your music is too good
You left a key hidden by the back door
But I never showed up
There was something sleazy about it
That made me wanna rob the place and run

Now I’ve been ignoring the calls
I’ve been riding my bike with no handlebars
Through empty streets in the dark
And I think I’m getting pretty good

Maybe I’ll leave the house tonight
Maybe I’ll even watch the band and maybe I’ll cry
Maybe I’ll tell everyone I cried while you
Sleep next to your wife for the rest of your life
While I’m ridin’ in the dark
On my bike with no handlebars
Yeah

And I heard it from a friend
That he talks to the primary school kids through the fence
Yeah you shoulda seen his book collection
It was all ‘how to socialise and how to make friends’
Yeah I guess we both got our problems
And areas to improve
And I know one of mine is to go a night without sympathising with you

I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you and being fine
For the rest of my life
Its just me on that bike
Yeah and I’ll wave to you as I ride by
How it always ends up like this
Two lovers staring at each other through a phone screen, lost
For this, I really can’t find the time
Trying to keep running with my life, ‘cause if I stop
I’m lost

Hope you know where you are
I hope someone’s lent you their guitar
I know you’re out feeling everything and I’m in bed watching season one of LOST

Keep running to save face
We’re still living like dogs in space, lost
With so little direction
Of course, I haven’t forgotten you
Such an impossible thing to do, but if I look back
I’m lost

Hope you know where you are
I hope you feel like you’ve gotten far
And maybe you were told you were special one too many times and now you’re lost

Maybe I don’t get it
Maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I don’t get it
Maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I don’t get it
Maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I’ll never get it
I’m just lost

Now it always ends up like this
It’s just me staring at couples across the street and they look so clean and happy
But, I don’t wanna end up like that
Going through the motions of lying in bed back to back
How it always ends up like that

I wanna be losers forever
Drink coffee in bed together
And not talk to anyone and figure out what it is that we had lost
What it is that we had lost
You said you hate yourself
So let me feed you strawberries
Off a plate I bought from a widow
Who was selling her husbands things
And we'll see if you still hate yourself

If you still hate yourself
I'll eat you out for an hour in your room
'Cause I love giving head

If you still hate yourself
We'll cut ourselves and swallow
Chunks of broken glass
I don't care about finishing college

I'll buy the biggest TV
That my credit card allows me
We'll watch the food network for the rest of our lives

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh-oh
The sun is hidden
Behind the clouds
The sun goes down
I see it fall
I write your name
At the grocery store
I want to see
What it's like to be you


I'm lying down
It's raining now
When things are gone
You can't have them back
I close my eyes
It's late at night
I hope I won't
Have that dream again
I have no longterm plans for this body
I want to be part of you while I still can
My mouth filled up with blood
Let me be part of you while I still can
When am I coming to your school
You know that I should see you soon
Before something takes me out of here
Or before he takes you away again
(I woke up in the library and someone was whispering your name directly into my ear. I looked around but I couldn't find them and when I wen't outside, the sun was out but soon the sky turned black and it started to rain; my friends blame ghosts for everything)
I worry far too much and I know
That it will ruin us
Just like it ruined so many things before
Let me be part of you while I still can
When am I coming to your school
Remember I should see you soon
Cause soon I won't be able to
If things keep going on like this
I stare at myself in the mirror
I make my body bleed sometimes
I don't even dream anymore
Because my dreams are coming true
And I could die in your red hair
I could die in your red hair
And I could die in your red hair
I could die in your red hair
I wanna be haunted
I wanna be loved
I want a lot of friends and
A lot of drugs
I wanna be haunted
I won’t leave my bed
I won’t go crazy and
I won’t get sad

So haunt me, haunt me, haunt me, ooh
So haunt me, haunt me, haunt me, ooh
So haunt me, haunt me, haunt me, ooh
So haunt me, haunt me, haunt me, ooh

...And follow the path you were destined to have. You know, oftentimes we don't slow down to think about the grudges, resentments, and anger that we hold on to every day, in our bodies, in our hearts, and in our minds. Whether you're aware of it or not, I am willing to bet you that there is a way that you are disappointed in yourself, that there is a way that-
Everything I like is going to hell
And everyone I like is living in hell
I’ve got no use for friends, only connections
Give me what I want and leave me alone

And in five years from now, I’ll be living in hell
In ten years from now, I might as well be dead
When I wake up at night, I'm floating above
The sheets on my bed
I’ve got no use for time, I’ve got enough
Give me what I want and leave me alone
I wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight
I wouldn't even put up a fight
I wouldn't care if you took it all away today
I'm sure i wouldn't even miss the pain
But i know i've got to live my life and roll around on the ground
And feel the strife and realize along the way
That i'm nothing more than a grain of salt in the salt of the earth
And everything is grace
So come on with the darkness
Come on with the fear
Cause i've got to start somewhere
And it might as well be here
And when i'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight
I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride
And laugh at myself
A brave morning, thoughts flap their wings and fly
And I can still taste defeat on my lips
Bright tie, fish fly, I have not yet arrived
How can I not admit, I need to know you

'Cause I just want to be
Something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

Hey sorrow, where are you?
Tomorrow just won't be the same without you here
I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad to bear
And strength to hold my head above them

'Cause I just want to be
Something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

'Cause Gloria is silent, Gloria is silent
Gloria is silent and glory is a silent thing
Summer unfolded like a tapestry
And you were there as you have always been
There glowing where the sky meets with the trees
Air softly crowing, singing fears to sleep
Will you ever know how much I love you for that?
Will you ever know how much I love you?
I wish you could put your ear up to my heart
And hear how much I love you
I wish you could put your ear up to my heart
And hear how much I love you
I still dream of December
Dancing together
With rings on our fingers
And the two shall become
And the two shall become, become
There I was, fourteen spinning
With my arms out like a scarecrow

Walking down Monroe to the park
Dancing up Madison

With my eyes closed
Your feet sounding like a symphony of strings
You picked me up and whispered "Forever"
Like a secret in my ears, now
You started crying right in front of me
So then i embraced you and i swore i'd never let you go
I would never let you hurt yourself, like i do
Then i pulled you tighter and i never wanted to let go
Try to see it through my eyes - for the first time
Understand, it's further from the truth
Try to see it through my eyes - for the last time
Understand, it's further from the truth
Just the other day you were standing next to me with tears in your eyes
My eyes are blurring
The colors washes out
I need to see it with my own eyes
I've started... I've started to fade out
I just wish i could believe in what i see
Don't show the tears in your eyes
Don't show what i'm becoming
I keep begging you to see
Why won't you ever listen?
You have got me into this
You will show me the way out...out of this
As you say there's nowhere i can go
As you say there's no-one i can trust
As you say we're all alone out there. as
You say we can never...never be clean. as a shadow
Hiding my eyes from the sun
You walk through the door of trust to never come again
But you will stay in my
Memory like a bird in a cage
You will never be released from my mind. save me
Please. and it always comes down to this
Wake me up, and open my eyes
This to an end, night time turns to dawn
In the corner of your eye
I remember how we listened to our song
In the middle of the night
We
Were too afraid to go to sleep
We
Were too afraid to fall asleep
How it came over me
When I saw your arms
What have you done?
(Feel so small)
I saw what you tried to hide
From everyone else
I saw what you tried to hide
From everyone else
I promised you, I promised you
That I would take care of you
I promised you, I promised you
That I would be there for you
I promised you...
Just like I did
That other time when I thought i could be at help
Just like I did
That other time when I thought I could...
I thought
I could
Save
Another
Person
I wish I could be good
I wish I could matter to someone
Just someone
I wish I could be you (I wish you could)
I wish I could see you (I wish you could see me now)
I wish you could see me now
I need you now
I wish
Wish you could see me now
Signs, what's with those signs?
Would they explain it to you?
Silent words. and
The words describe what's gone through our heads
Feels impossible to think that
Memories of now will ever fade
I'm silently watching your movements as you
Walk through the room
I'm watching your eyes moving across the floor and all
The dust in my room
This silent is so painful, don't you think?
You'd just say
I'm having "one of those days" again
But i know i'm not
Can't believe we even
Sat on the same train
Looking out different windows in silent. we've been
Trying to ignore this for so long
I've really let this gone too far
One of
These days i simply will ask you
Didn't know it was up to me all along
Is it really? is it so?
All this time you could have told me, right?
You just shut me out with your silence. i thought you lied
Dance, this silent dance of loneliness. stumble and fall
It's only bitterness and tears
The daily flood of the eyes
I remember when i thought i forgot about it all, and then how you
Proved me wrong
This train is heading nowhere in a speed too high
Even though we're not at the same place we're still inside
We're still sharing
The same
View = each others eyes
First time i saw you
My heart skipped a beat
First time i held your hand
I shaked like a leaf
It didn't have to come to this, if you had just leaved it alone
I never wanted you to see what i've kept inside of me
There is a darkness inside of me, eating on me from within
I never thought i would be like this, scared to fall down
I don't see a way
I could become whole
I hate what i've become
There is a darkness inside of me, eating on me from within
I never thought i would be like this, scared of myself to burst
The nights grow longer and longer. It's getting darker every day
This time of year everything's dying
This is the first day of the rest of my life
Yesterday was the last day of a life together with you
First time i saw you my heart skipped a beat
I think i'm losing all that was me
First time we held hands i shaked like a leaf
All this time you wasted on me, i can't give it back
I think i'm losing what you liked about me
What you liked about me
First time i saw you
My heart skipped a beat
And for each day that goes we drift further
I think i'm losing what i used to be
I think i'm losing my personality
And for each day that goes we drift further
You should never see this side of me
I don't want you to see what i turned out to be
This is the last day i will look you in the eyes
Tomorrow won't be the day you will see what i wished to be
I can still see you on the shore
I keep drifting further from you
And i watch you as i'm floating
It's been three whole years of me thinking about you every day
Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing
Saw you from the bottom of the staircase
Stood out for hours as you complained
About how you haven't seen your friends yet
That you're too drunk to stand and
You not knowing if you can love him forever
Bullshit, you fucking miss me
There, I said it, I guess I'll talk to you in a few months
Sitting drunk on the sidewalk
I guess I'll get up
I guess I'll go for a walk
Press my shoes against the pavement
I swear this has gotta be the hundredth
Time I've thought of you tonight

You weren't the only one
Who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Where I let you walk away

Used to call you a crook, called you a bandit
There ain't no other good damn reason why
My heart, it would go missing
For so many months so I was wishing that you
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you?
And to never forget it
Oh, just forget it

You weren't the only one
Who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Where I let you walk away
You weren't the only one
Who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Go ahead and walk away
I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my current problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's all right, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway
Ah, well, I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me
I'm so tired or maybe just bored
I can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you
And I know that you just adore
Starting off with me, that way that there's no way that I'll assume
That you're wasting all of my time
To vent about your problems like how your Instagram stopped working
And how your friends bailed on you
But it was funny cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me (Yeah... about that...)
I'm guilty as charged for leading you on
A lie that I know is easy to see
But it's crucial to blot out any
Signs that I might have feelings
This way you don't ask me how am I
This way you won't force me to proceed
With actually having to tell you my worries
With actually having you give a damn about me
You giving a damn about

I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my fucking problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's alright, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway
Ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me
When I was just a boy
We'll call it 15 or so
I found myself annoyed
By a syndrome of sorts in my bones
That girl who's next to me
(Wait, next to- right next to me? Oh, god-)
She found herself bored to tears
She realized if she wanted conversation-
She's out of luck for three more years
When I moved away from home
100 miles or so
I knew a change had grown
Inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones
That girl who's next to me
She's friendly and thoughtful, and quite awfully pretty
But all she has to say
Is a meat-head-themed monologue on why Brad ran away
She said, "All I can hope for is for me to get better
Cause all I can take is no more
I'll win him back again, we'll be lovers, best friends
He won't need no other woman, like he did way back when
He was with me
He needed more than me
I'm friendly and thoughtful, and quite awfully pretty
But he needed more than me."
When I felt that I should leave
We'll call it midnight or so
I found myself annoyed
By a syndrome of sorts in her bones
That girl who's next to me
She don't know her worth in this town
Because her face starts to shine
When that meat head behind me
Is grinning as he's checking her out
(Oh, c'mon!)
I said, "All I can hope for is for you to get better
Cause all I can take is no more
So I'll hide where I can
Away from you and your friends
Leaking tears over beers once again."
Leaking tears over beers once again
You're leakin' tears over bears once again
Is he here? Are you making out?
I can you hear you guys on the couch
Shut up. Make out
Do something already. I'm waiting
After reading that text from your friends
I start losing all my confidence
So I'll stay tired, I know soon I'll be bailing
Then you, you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no
My head is on the verge of exploding
No amount of aspirin or pizza could help this from hurting
And now I'm turning to you scared shitless
Hoping this song goes well
Can we highlight the fact that
My mouth smells like coffee and garlic
The five cups I had this morning are getting to me
I gotta go I got the worst fucking spins
Then you, you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no
But we’re so caught up in the moment
And I just need a second to catch my goddamn breath (Fuck it)

To hell with the spins I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch planet earth and brainstorm tattoos
To hell with class, I'm skipping
Let's order food and sleep in
I've got so much to do
But it's ok cause whatever, forever

To hell with the spins I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch planet earth and brainstorm tattoos
Though I seem cool, calm and collected
Making my way to hipster with glasses
Was a little more than just nerve wrackin'
Kinda’ just counted on her to turn me into goo
Praise Whatever it ended with a smile
Cause for a bit, a tad, a little while
I expected you two, to save the day with sly remarks
Like "he's so cute" and "whatever you want"s
Though the white jacket didn't fit
The friends I came with did, perfectly
Snugged right to my body
Like sad movies and late night drinks
Could’ve guessed by the end of the hour
There was more than just a little smile on my face
Covered in custard and cookies and cream
Pissed off I had to leave
But all has to end
You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here
Real dark around here
Most of my old friends
I can only stand for the weekend
But that doesn't apply here
Doesn't apply here
The day started with a bloody drip
And a taste on my lips
That was a lot less than desired
Awkward moments to the side
Not all expiring fast
A tank top that didn't cover a thing
And a zipped down hoodie
Zipped to the bottom
Had us laughing every time
No matter how many chest hairs there were in sight
You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here
Real dark around here
Most of my old friends
I can only stand for the weekend
But that doesn't apply here
Doesn't apply here
I'm so sorry for the things I've done
And what I did to you is up there number 1
So sweaty of palm and tongue tied tight
We'll sit here and talk late into the night

Yesteryear still rings in my ear
Like buttons and pins this mess we're in
Dissolves in time

I know this time is quite different from when we first met
The years haven't been kind worn down by regret
So take hope there's still enough of what made this young man left
All that once was is not quite
Gone yet

Cause we are old friends you and I
Many a time sat silent at my side
And if this is to be our last goodbye
I'll take with me a part of you that never dies

Yesteryear still rings my ear
Like buttons and pins this mess we're in
Dissolves in time

I know this time is quite different from when we first met
The years haven't been kind worn down by regret
So take hope there's still enough of what made this young man left
All that once was is not quite
Gone yet


I know this time is quite different from when we first met
The years haven't been kind worn down by regret
So take hope there's still enough of what made this young man left
All that once was is not quite gone
Gone yet
Once more in to breaches I cannot gap
One more chance to second guess your thoughts
My friends said that you would be a tough nut to crack
Come back lets settle this up…
…and down my spine
The faint tingle keeps me up at night
So while you dream I lie awake and look to the stars
No answers forthcoming I find myself locked in your arms
Once more in to breaches I cannot gap
One more chance to second guess your thoughts
My friends said that you would be a tough nut to crack
Come back lets settle this up
Like earth and dust
We’re one and the same; insignificant
Well who am I to presume that we were all but gone?
Perpetually complexing the simple. I for one am done
You brought this on yourself
Our problems had enough time on the shelf
We made the same mistakes
Lived our lives without the give and the take
The time we spent apart
Served to remind me of when we’d talk
My one and sole regret
Are the thoughts that went left unsaid
So far we’ve lost focus
Lets just concentrate on words that could mean everything
On nights like this
We drink ourselves dry
And make promises
Without intention
So fortunate that this was brought up
The last time. As I recall
I can’t hold up your every expectation
On nights like this
We drink ourselves dry
And make promises
Without intention
My God, is this what we’ve become?
Living parodies of love and loss
Can we really be all that lost?
So fortunate that this was brought up
The last time. As I recall
I can’t hold up your every expectation
One moment to another I am restless
Seems making love forever can often risk your heart
And I cannot remember when I was this messed up
In service of another I am beautiful
While time waits for no man
I’ll be here in winter
Tear down your baracades
So I may enter
Your lips are warm
They comfort me
Open up
And let's begin
So I’ll lay on this
Bed that I have made
So soundly sleep
And whisper your name
Oooooh you, you burn me up
One touch and I am in
A trance like state
Entwining our fates to another
The cost of our will now both bound to each other
What was in your head
When you said
“until death”?
The marks upon your skin
Tell tales while envy
Mocks without remorse
And ties you up in knots
One touch and I am in
A trance like state
Entwining our fates to another
The cost of our will now both bound to each other
What was in your head
When you said
“until death”?
Your lies unfold
Like lines that were left
In turn and consequently
Told all
I’m in love
Are the 3 words I hope to hear next year
Another place another time another twinkle in eyes caught between awkward glances
In crowded social scenes, another breeding ground for apathy
To tire me into indifference
Now that I’m numb
To places I had run from
Know when you’re wrong
It’s cause you’re fallible, just like everyone
Just stuck between a lampshade and the drunk
Sentenced to an evening as the party entertainment’s prop
Oh but it’s only you that I am thinking of
Please return to me, cause it’s so…
So hard to take that I might break
I’m discovering that there’s so much to consider worthwhile
But most of all I’ve learned to hate that I’m still stuck on you
If time has taught us this much
It’s that honesty is the cornerstone of trust
Well to tell the truth I’m tired of watching clocks
Waiting for endings of evenings that never seem to stop. Enough
In short I’ve come
Back to the places I had run from
You saw it all
Fall to pieces, now it’s so...
So hard to take that I might break
I’m discovering that there’s so much to consider worthwhile
But most of all I’ve learned to hate that I’m still stuck on you
Waking up to your voice, such a pretty noise
Couldn't believe you didn't wake up with some different boy
Oh, I'm the last pick of all your draft picks
Lining up my words so they're all cleverly crafted
You could see right through
Oh, oh

She thinks that love's this sick little disease that attacks you
But I could fall deep in it every day if I had to
Oh, with you it's so easy to
Drop all those things I had to do
Oh, it's fine, never a waste of my time

I want a love where we stop going to church 'cause it's boring
And sleep in on all those Sunday mornings
The sun would creep in through the blinds
We would hide underneath the sheets
Trying to find
A million ways to kill the time

But I never really know what you're thinking about
And I know I'll never really figure it out
All experience ever does is confirm my doubts
Wasn't convinced that I'd ever really come around
'Cause it's funny how life goes, you know?
Like there's just shit I don't need anyone to know
Like this girl out there somewhere, I don't know
But I wonder all the time if she ever misses the snow

And all these thoughts I can't push out of my mind
Like these visions of a hundred twisted ways I might die
The view from there was kinda nice
Action was kinda slow
Again, these are things I don't need anyone to know

Oh
I can't believe I thought I was safe
In my most crooked shape
Most vulnerable place
And all that time I was hanging on your shelf
I was just running away from getting to know myself
Tell me what you want Nathan?
(You never seem to know when you have it already)
Tell me what you need Annie?
(You only ever notice a few seconds too late)
It's insane
And I mean if you want
We can just stay here
Wrap me in your claws
I can be your reindeer
When they turn out the lights
That way I can write your name here
'Cause we know what you like
You can have it every day here
'Cause I was wrong and this is my repent
Things sped up, I stopped making sense
I mean if you want
We can just stay here
And I know I need something now
I can feel this change coming on inside of me
I know I'm different now
My ocean's swelling up inside
Whenever you're away it's insane
Oh no, big wave
Oh no, big, big wave
Both our eyes broke open at once
Noise from the kids on the street having fun
The sun made its way into your living room
I said "ah, our old friend," you said "man I hate that thing"

That's the last time I felt me there

Yeah, but I still come through when you want
It's like if I serve no use, where will I get my purpose from?
And then it always changes
The second we see the sun

Both our eyes broke open at once
Noise from the kids on the street having fun
The sun made its way into your living room
And oh, to know where you have been, that costs the trust that I have spent

That's the last time I felt you there

Yeah, but I still come through when you want
It's like if I serve no use,  where will I get my purpose from?
And then it always changes
The second we see the sun

I love it, yes I do
(Oh no I think I love them more)
I love it, yes I do
(Oh no I think I love them more)
I love it, yes I do
(Oh no I think I love them more)
I love you, yes I do
Oh no, no, I'm not really sure

Don't know
A raincloud in your head
(It's still raining)
The monkey on your back
(He's still hanging)
And I'm stuck here, a waste, complaining to you
(Always complaining)

Goodbye, old love
Hello, new friend
This is where it ends and then begins again
Goodbye, old love
Hello, new friend
This is where it ends and then begins again
(Ta, ta, ta, tell me what you meant)
Goodbye, old love
(Ta, ta, ta, tell me what you meant)
Hello, new friend
(Ta, ta, ta, tell me what you meant)
This is where it ends and then begins again
(Ta, ta, ta, tell)
And then begins again
So long, subtle alien vibes
Think I've been making progress in microscopic strides
So don't ask, 'cause I never could tell
All I need is four walls to make it my own hell

Hell yeah, so what?
Watch an optimist drink half-empty cups
Well I'll grow, we'll see
If there's something good in me

My eyes lit up when I saw it
A way out of looking for everything I wanted
My eyes lit up when I saw it
The view from where you sit
And apathy, I was in love with it

So long, narrow hollowing road
Thinking I'm turning back, it's the only way I knew

And it shows for so long
Turning half rights into full-on wrongs
Oh fuck, I'm gone
Another 4 AM song

My eyes lit up when I saw it
A way out of looking for everything I wanted
My eyes lit up when I saw it
The view from where you sit
And apathy, I was in love with it
And apathy, I was in love with it

But not as much as the phone ringing
Not as much playing my house
Not as much as the way her goddamn voice sounds
It's like taking in sun
And then taking it back
I fall into old habits
I'm stepping over your cracks again

My eyes lit up when I saw it
A way out of looking for everything I wanted
My eyes lit up when I saw it
The view from where you sit
And apathy, I was in love with it
And apathy, I was in love with it
Little jagged edge
I'm leaning in, again
I felt it when you said
That I'd adjust the mess
There was nothing I could do
To see your point of view
And that's the truth

She says, "I hate the taste of the rust"
I said, "I hate how I think, I think too much"
But that's alright

These days, it feels like all I know is this phase
I hope I'm basking in the glow
And these days, it feels like all I know is this phase
I hope I'm basking in the glow
Is there something bigger I don't know?

So I take another sip
'Cause I'm still not sick of it
And I guess if the shoe fits
You'll know when I quit
'Cause it never seems to fail
The weaker side prevails
And my weaker side prevails

And I hate the way I miss your touch
I hate these songs I sing, this empty drink
Do I even give a fuck?
Well, I don't know

These days, it feels like all I know is this phase
I hope I'm basking in the glow
And these days, it feels like all I know is this phase
I hope I am basking in the glow
Oh, I am basking in the glow

Cut me up, I've said enough
Learned this lesson far too much
It'll only bring you down
Carrying someone around
In your head, in your head

And there's days it feels like all I know is her face
And I'm just basking in its glow
And those days it feels like all I know is this phase
I hope I'm basking in the glow
Yes, I am basking in the glow
Oh god, I'm basking in the glow
Something bigger, I don't know
I'll find a way to your house
It's dark and it's raining, it's nice out
I'll bite my tongue when your friends around
We'll meet at a mall in a new town
I can't believe that it's dark out
It's 6:45 and my headlights
Are telling me I have to go now
My car likes to slide when it's wet and
My hands are still cramping
Less than they were when around you
I tense all my muscles to your view
Spend all my time trying soda
To tell myself I'm just as new to you
Anxiety likes to control us
You comfort the fact that you're still you
I am afraid that I know you
I'm just afraid that I know you
I'm just afraid that I know you so well
You'll find a place with a backyard
A place that you can still run to
Drinking a lot in the morning
Knowing that it's gonna kill you
I'll find a way to go home now
Under a bridge self-loathing
You can't survive without caffeine
Your friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear
Your friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear
And I'll find a way to fix things
I don't understand what your texts mean
I'm hiding my feelings in blue screens
This isn't how things are meant to be
I understand the pros of
Following you through a crowded house
I sat in the grass with my phone out
I don't understand all the yelling
(The yelling) accomplishes nothing
I'm stressed cause you're stressed when you call me
I'm feeding off negative energy
Falling in love with the same scene
Making mistakes isn't new to me
Anxiety sucks it's controlling
I miss how we dealt with the old things
When playing in houses was new to me
I was playing in houses with friends I cared about
And I knew you so well
I'm always thinking, are you alright?
It's best to leave things like that alone
And I guess I hit a soft spot
A spot where your newfound friends can't go
And I sat on your table, my hands resembled heartbeats
I wonder if you're able to feel my body heat
I always feel your body heat
And I'm following your shoe marks
Wondering if you can make it home
And I'm guessing I'm not far off
Thinking that your drink had stained your clothes
You just wanna feel in place here
And I'll always understand
The statements we will make here
I never wanna fall in love again
Like a train in the morning
I'll wake you up without warning
And I love the west coast
I'm tired of holding my friends to a city
Without a single reason, not to leave
You said you'll go to Seattle
And make some money selling weed
Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong
Stop romanticizing problems
It's killing children every day
And I'm sitting on a stairwell
Making sure that you're okay
And you say you're on drugs now
And the world's a beautiful place
Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong
Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong
Love how you disappear, if I need you
You're sleeping, I get that, I want you to know that I try
To figure out, where I'm going
And where I'm sleeping, and how much emotion is showing
And one can only imagine the things that you think of
I want to see the country, without goodbyes
But I can't afford that, so fuck my life
And all these guessing games
And they all just feel the same, and I'm sorry
When did I leave the seventh grade?
You feel sick, I'm tired, I don't even know what to say
My words can't make my problems go away
You say I lose things, that I can't find
There's no more covers, left to hide in
You say I'm lazy, incompetent, I'm always too tired to try
Everyone's stuck, living their "skewed up version of life"
And now I have a job, and Bobby's living in Tallahassee
I wish I had tried more
And all these guessing games
And they all just feel the same, and I'm sorry
When did I stop thinking this way?
I feel sick, I'm tired, I don't even know what to say
Your words can't make my problems go away
And all these guessing games
And they all just feel the same, and I'm sorry
When do I stop feeling this way?
I feel sick, you're tired, we don't even know what to say
My words can't make my problems go away
Held in a bong hit, sitting in a
Hot tub in south Wisconsin, I feel
Amazing when I’m all alone
Switching between porn and RoboCop
Turned off my cell phone, drank a bottle
Of wine and read a Cometbus and
Passed out naked, shriveling, stumbled
To bed in a fucked up sleepwalk

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea

I read the worst thing ever in a
Bathrobe of off-white terry cloth
Translated by technology from
Your voice extremely inaccurately

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I’m the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up, oh no!

Cleaned up the empty bottles, let the
Smoke out through chilly windows
I used the stationary bike
And I watched the end of The Price Is Right
Ordered an egg-white sandwich and I
Drove south through mid-day traffic and I
Called up some folks I truly love and
Hung up after they said hello

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I’m the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Someone's gonna bleed and dribble trails in the snow
Stretching to the bus from an overstuffed home
We begged to explode
Laura said to me, "This decade's gonna be fucked
Friends will disappear after they fall in love (Fall in love)
Fall in love and get married
Isn't that shit like, crazy?
The workin', havin' babies and promotions?
The cheatin', cryin', leavin', and divorcin'?"
As we're bouncing up and down trying to make the floor break
Stop sneering at our joy like it's a careless mistake
You fuckheads complain because you like to complain
Like I blame rock and roll when it's just the champagne
That keeps me detaching from reality
Just waiting for someone to come and save me
Won't somebody fucking please come and save me?
Oh please, hurry up, someone, come and save me
From all these magic moments I've forgotten
All these magic moments I've forgotten
On a weary floor that can’t support all of us
In a giddy haze and dancing carpet to dust
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ll forget once the magic is gone
It feels completely ridiculous
That I'm a willing participant
Gazing at the purples and pinks
In the shadow of a bank-sponsored skyline
"Unite against the establishment!"
While drones transmit the images
To a server farm in the valley
For a culture that'll eat its own insides

Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take

Take a long look at the billboards
That smother the air till you can't ignore 'em
And glamorize department store crust-punk-chic
'Cause Satan's trending up and it's fashion week
But this is not a movement, it's just careful entertainment
For an easy demographic in our sweatshop denim jackets
And we'll wonder, "What just happened?"
When the world becomes Manhattan
Where the banks steal the apartments just to render them abandoned

Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take

We're not stupid people, but this financial oppression
Has got everyone believing all that we can do is nothing
'Cause we organize through avenues they lace with advertisements
So the ones we try to rage against are still lining their pockets

Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take
I've been doing this for half my years;
I've been mouthing off in bars, trading shame for self-respect
My trajectory is crystal clear
I can see it in the stars that frame the shame above my neck
And the sky is always pitch black
When I sneak away, I only wanna come back and see your face, see your face again
I want to listen to The Cribs, my dear, while we make out in your car
And fuck the haters who object -- they've overrated self-respect
The sky is always pitch black when I sneak away
I only wanna come back to see your face, to see your face again
Not borne on beams from outer space through AMOLED displays
To see your face again
Dumbfounded, downtrodden, and dejected
Crestfallen, grief-stricken, and exhausted
Trapped in my room while the house was burning to the motherfuckin' ground
I saw the sign but it was misleading
I fought the law, but the law was cheating
Screaming for help, but somebody keeps on telling me to settle down

And please be honest
And tell me, was it you?

Clerk at the Midwestern service station
Striped uniform, giggling at catch phrases
Look in her eyes like we’re up to something
Oh, it doesn't matter now
Man in a crossover with his family
Sketched-in decals on the window smiling
Drivin' parallel in the lane beside me
Oh, it doesn't matter now

But please be honest
And tell me, was it you?
I won't hate you
I just need to know
Please be honest
And tell me, was it you?

At first he thought it was the undertow
But he was dragged to the bottom of the lake
By a couple of kids saying, "It's a joke"
Though he didn't know any of their names
As they held him down, the crowd got loud
And they cheered when they thought he had escaped
When the anchor needed something for the 10 o'clock
What could they say?
Oh, what else could they say?
They said
"Well, you promised us the stars
Well, you promised us the stars
Well, you promised us the stars
Well, you promised us the stars
And now we’re tired and bored" (x62)
(et tu, USA
Et tu, et tu, USA)
I think it's 'bout time
That I warned you I might cry in front of you
And I don't want you to feel
Like I'm afraid of the truth
I didn't want you to feel
Like it was all your fault
But that doesn't mean
That I wanted you to feel nothing at all

What do you want me to say
When I can't tell you the truth?
Please tell me how the fuck
I'm supposed to deal with losing you

So what's the point of talking
If you're not changing your mind?
It just reminds me of the lying
And it's wasting my time
So was it worth it to me?
To wait around and then see
If all my love was well spent
My night time hikes and weekends
You are my best friend
And I don't want this to end

What do you want me to say
When I can't tell you the truth?
Please tell me how the fuck
I'm supposed to deal with losing you

It wasn't worth it to me
To wait around and then see
If all my love was well spent
My night time hikes and weekends
You were my best friend
I didn't want it to end
Sorry, it's just, people are complaining (Too bad!)
You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again? Or- (No!)
...play on beat and just do it right? (No!) All right
Let's stop foolin' around and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom jeans revenge machine! (Yeah!)
Mom Jeans!

What do you want me to say?
It's never going away
'Cause I'm stuck on you like the smell
Of cigarettes on your flower dress

I want you under my fingernails
I want you in my sleep and in my dreams
I wake up spooning my pillow
Sweaty hands but please don't tell your friends

Now I'm addicted to cigarettes
At first I didn't let myself inhale
But smoke got through and so did you
And now every burn hole smells like home

And I know it's killing me
But that still won't stop me
'Cause now we smell the same
But you still kill me faster

I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too, guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too, guess I'm just like you


I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too, guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too, guess I'm just like you


I don't mind
That you lie sometimes
Because I lie too
Guess I'm just like you
It's hard for me to see exactly
Where the hell I went wrong
I never thought I'd see the day
We wouldn't get along
You think I smoke too much
I think your friends all suck
Can't figure out the reason why our parents fight so much
But I've given up on luck
But I'm happy here
I'm happy here

So leave my sweater on the porch
I'll leave your bag under the stairs
Don't go back to our old place
It's probably locked up anyway
I bet it still looks the same as when I ran away that day
It doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I'm
Happy here, yes I'm
Happy here, I'm
Happy here, I'm
Happy here

I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
Is it so much to ask that you text me back?
I'm so scared of losing touch, I'm forced to ask if you know that
The reason why I try so hard to be nice
Is so no one else will leave me behind
You're right that it's not that hard to tell the ones that you love
How much they mean and how you'd feel if it was them and not us
But I can't make the time in my life to be sad every time you're around me

Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum

How did it make you feel to know you're not quite enough?
For someone who took so much from you and then just gave up
On the things that used to make me so glad I was the one holding your hand
'Cause I'm not too busy, I'm just still dizzy trying to
Catch my fucking breath through these sweat-soaked sheets
But you're still so pretty and I'm still too skinny to hold
All this weight on my own

Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum

But I find the time to tell everyone I love
That someday, I won't need them anymore, but that's because
They've given me everything I need to be me
You let me be me

I'm not going back to my bed before I find a way to tire myself out
It seems that everything tires me out except trying to get some rest
Baby I'm sorry
Things didn't work out the way that I planned
But we both know that planning's not my strong suit
I'm sad that I lost you, but I won't chase you
I still don't blame you for making me stall
When I learned how to drive your car
Because your best friends were all too sad to take you to the airport
But I miss you every minute of every day
Tell me, why can't you still make a decision?
'Cause I'm getting better at
Crying without making any noise
All I want is your voice in my head
And your hair in my bed

Please tell me why I'm so afraid of dying alone
So scared and so stoned
But I don't know what I need, so just tell me what you need
You're all I need
Just please don't make me
Life's just a pissing contest
And nobody exists on purpose
Things might not get any better
But they might get a little easier
You make me feel like a bug who has lived a full life
Like a bee who has never had to sacrifice it's stinger
If you have the time, call me when you can
If you have the time, call me when you can
Life's just a pissing contest
And nobody exists on purpose
If you have no idea where you're going
It's fine, neither does anyone
Or maybe we could go together
Maybe we could go together
Walked 10 miles to a hole in the ground
The only ghosts that I see are pieces of you still reflected in me
I hope you destroy yourself
Drive fast into the burning bridge
And leave me on the side of the road
But you'll live
It will be a ritual of remembering
Hang your family from your living room ceiling fan with your small intestine
But they'll live and it will be
A ritual of remembering
You said no matter how many candles I light in a black mass
It will never change everything that i still lack
But I'm still waiting for pieces of your ear in the mail
And I'm still carving "I am my own god"
Deeper into my forearm every day
So what the fuck has changed?
Yellow paint won't save the world, my little Van Gogh
And you deserve so much happiness
You deserve so much more than this
You deserve so much more than this
Empty wall
Shadows in the halls
Ghosts in the window
Chills in the home, though you left the candle burning
Wolves scratching at the back door
Goodbyes written in a letter, taped to the table:
Nothing has gotten better, nothing is getting better

Past the point of painting bravely pushing payments that i don't have from my bank account
It can't be so bad, each according to the rule
You never underestimated the superflous zeus and leda with the swan
Making due so often on the back wall hiding behind neptune "what is that"?
You could never strike a deal as heavy as his him when the plan is bobbed and rich topped
I wish it was mine and I wish I had the same dimes as he had well
Always thought he'd cock it up but if nothing will we'll lock it up but he did it right, he locked it up
I can't even touch it now
And I don't know what to do with these bones, these bones
I never had my heart, is hell a song?

Fuck your ghost town, I'm burning the house to the ground
And nothing is getting better and nothing is getting better

Nothing is getting any better
Grief creeps quietly backwards
My mood ring has never changed back from black
You can find me recreating nightmares
I spent 3 nights falling asleep in snow banks
Hoping my feelings would freeze over
I want to push myself through the ice
To see the world from underwater
Find me hanging neck broken on your front porch
Daisy in my pocket
I'm floating above all things that keep me up at night
I am a bruise
Pushed over your mountainous trail over and over and over
How painful is this life?
Do you want to die like you know I do?
How painful is this life?
Do you want to die like you know I do?
Soft thoughts, pink bruises
Floral blankets, sunday afternoons
You plucked flowers from my mother's garden
To lay across my cold, gray grave
Walked past a doe with a throat covered in blood
On your walk home
Drank wine straight from the bottle that evening
Kissed your girlfriend on the palms and went to bed
All you've ever done was take
All you've ever done was take
You are slowly unravelling pieces of you
That were sewn into me so well
I figured I lost you on the first sunday in June
There was no rain in April
And no flowers in May
It's been two years, and you're still taking
And I'm still paying
And I'm still paying
Every day has been like Sunday
Silent and gray
Every day has been like Sunday
Silent and gray
Black hair, nails on a chalk board
Walls covered in maps, sunday afternoons
And everyday has been like Sunday
Silent and gray
Silent and gray
I hate every-
One that I know
Then I wonder
“Where did my friends go?”
(x2)
Fucking poor me
Fucking poor me
Always suffering
Always suffering
(x2)
Everyone will let me down, one way or the other. (x2)
One day I’ll be dead and gone, maybe then we’ll get along. (x2)
I’m not holding my breath
I die holding my breath
What do I know? I know nothing
What do I know? I know nothing
I know nothing
 (x2)
All my
Sad songs
Have been used up, they’ve had enough
Of my heartsick, thrown-up bull-shit
Em I need this
I left my heart at home
Somewhere, I don’t know
Fed it to the lions
In some act of violence
I’m feeling vague and I can’t seem to concentrate
On things that matter most; I’m slipping into the unknown
I’m no more. I’m not around
To hold your hand
We’re strangers, I’m sorry
I’m not around
To hold your hand
The night turns into the day, the sun eludes me
I don’t think I’m supposed to be happy here
(x2)
So
I
Run
Away
From
This
From
My-self
I
Drift
With
The wind
The sound of swaying trees helps me to fall asleep. The branches stop to ask
When are you coming back
The sound of swaying trees helps me to fall asleep. The branches stop to ask
When are you coming back
And I wake up and fucking spit in their face
Just because we're rooted doesn't mean we're in place
The sound of swaying trees helps me to fall asleep. The branches stop to ask
When are you coming back
At night I drift away
At night I drift away
At night I drift away
At night I drift away
Been feeling like the weather last year:
Lots of grey and anxious fear
Who am I to suggest things change? I hope for sun but it always rains
Been feeling like the weather last year:
Lots of grey and anxious fear
Look around at everything, the ship has sunk and so have we
Who am I to suggest things change? It'll always fucking rain
Why do I wake up?
Fuck this existing
Staring out windows that someone left open
Why do I wake up?
Fuck this existing
Staring out windows that someone left open
I feel the breeze as it passes through the wall
Into the sheets and clothes that smell like you
I feel the breeze as it passes through the wall
Into the sheets and clothes that smell like you
I'm miserable
I can't sleep
In this lonely bed
I'm miserable
I can't sleep
In this lonely bed
Sometimes-
It's just-
Too much-
When I'm-
Alone
So fill your lungs with emotion
You're just a kid and you're broken
Screaming that everything's unfair
You search for things left in last year
Watch as your life begins to fade
(You will grow up) pretending you are not afraid
(That's not enough.) (X2)
As your skin grows hard
And your heart turns numb
You realize the man
That you have become
As your skin grows hard
And your heart turns numb
You realize the man
That you have become
Now you're
Nothing!
Now you're
Nothing!
Searching for friends and the love that you're losing
Searching for something to keep you from moving
Searching for friends and the love that you're losing
Searching for something to keep you from moving backwards
Backwards
Here it is again, a heart of excitement
In the form of a girl who hates her life
As she sits alone on the floor of her bedroom
Waiting for answers, wasting time
Here it is again, the son of a soldier
Remington shotgun, rolled up sleeves
To keep Satan out of the walls of the suburbs
His last bastion of modernity
But Satan waits upstairs, watching over his daughter
She writes emo songs, she's so depressed
Her lyrics are naive but she still sings her heart out
The only way she knows how to confess
And as she gets up to shut the bedroom door behind her
He stands right beside her, she's trying to get her head on straight
With box dye hair to match her black thigh highs
And scratched nail polish, she performs femininity
She laughs so hard I watch her lose her balance, fall over backwards
To the arms of Mephistopheles
But she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community
He said you'll never be OK, K, if you don't come to your senses
With you everything's the end of the world
Melancholia can spread like a virus
I'm sure you got it from that stupid girl
You'll never be OK, if you don't come to your senses
But I feel so defenseless, so alone
I thought he was right when he said that he loved me
He's still thinking of me from up there
And as they stop to look at her they won't look further
Like it's not a murder, it's an inevitable tragedy
The bloody hands of all the heartless fuckers
Who emotionally fucked her to monetize her suffering
Flipping through a spiral notebook for some
Sad hopeless words to turn into a liturgy
So she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community
Da na na na naaa
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na NA na
NAA nana na na
Na na na na na
Na na na
No no no no no no no no no no
No no NO no, no no no no
Nonono no no NO no
No no no no no no
No NO NO NO, no no no no
Nonono no no NO no
No no no no no no no no no no
No nooo NO no, no no no no
Nonono no no NO no
No we'll never leave our bedrooms
We're a bedroom community
Here it is again, a heart of excitement
In the form of a girl who hates her life
As she sits alone on the floor of her bedroom
Waiting for answers, wasting time
How could I ever sleep at night?
My conscience left me petrified
Staring at the ceiling wide awake
Reliving all my worst mistakes
Til I finally got a decent job
And I got a place I'll never own
We'll knock some holes into the walls
To make it feel more like a home
How could I ever sleep at night?
When you left you left me paralyzed
Tryna keep my head above the waves
Holding out for brighter better days
And you boys just lift me up to let me down
Every single time you come around
I'm making friends who don't know who I am
Tryna turn the hurt into a brand
How could I ever sleep at night?
I'm blue dreaming about the better times
Anything to bring me close to you
Anything to take me back to
Friday nights
Foggy streets and Christmas lights
Wake me up on Saturday
Grab my hand and float away
Into the abyss again
And I will always be your friend
So grab my hand
Take my hand I can't do this alone
Friday nights
Foggy streets and Christmas lights
Wake me up on Saturday
Grab my hand and float away
Into the abyss again
And I will always be your friend
(Be your friend!)
So grab my hand
Take my hand I can't do this alone
Friday nights
Foggy streets and Christmas lights
Wake me up on Saturday
Grab my hand and float away
Into the abyss again
And I will always be your friend
(I'll be your friend!)
So grab my hand
Take my hand I can't do this alone
Na na na na nana na na
Na na na na nana na na
Na na na na nana na na
We'll make this feel more like a home
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
I love the way you make me feel
When I'm staring at my screen
At four AM
Trying not to fall asleep
And you hit me up just to see if I'm OK
I loved it way too goddamn much
When you told me you don't mind
When I keep you up
Sending Mamegoma Lines
You know it's shit like that that makes me wanna be alive
I wanna say I think it's OK if we just don't both feel the same way
But I feel like we're more than just friends
Cause it took six sad months to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather I just missed you and
I didn't miss the sweater weather I just missed you
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)
I used to think I'd get by fine
Tryna hide what's on my mind
Friendships felt feigned and
Strangers' shapes seemed so unkind
I was alone in crowds but not alone in sentiment
I've been so isolated by
The time I trade to stay alive
Brought up with the choice
Of success or suicide
So I'll call in sick again just to spend the day with you
Wanna say I think it's so gay that we really both feel the same way
That I feel, like we're more than just friends
It took too long to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather I just missed you
I didn't miss the sweater weather I just missed you
I didn't miss Orange County, i just missed you
I didn't miss 69 Tarocco, i just missed you
I didn't miss Culver City, i just missed you
Or getting drunk outside the Smell no I just missed you
Cuz I don't need the cold weather like i need you
And I don't need the sweater weather i just need you
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! hahahaha
I promise you're not wasting
Anybody's time
And all the things they've told you
Are so god damn rough, I understand
They said your friends will hurt you
And your friends don't really care
You told me you're their daughter
And they treat you this way just to keep you safe
So please listen clearly, I love you dearly
It hurts to see you so torn apart like this
Another sleepless night
To laugh about the times we tried to die
With heavy eyes
I'll stay awake with you
And we'll keep us alive
When the morning comes
In here
You'll be OK
And when your heart breaks
I'll be beside you
So please
Stay here with me
Breathe in like waves
On a glass beach
I stopped taking calls for the first time then I cut off my phone line
And took the Highway One for nowhere south
When Yuki said I should just call up family
And tell them how I felt
No one who loves you should make you feel so unsafe
No no one who loves you should make you feel alone
In here
You'll be OK
And when your heart breaks
I'll be beside you
So please
Stay here with me
Breathe in like waves
On a glass beach
Blood in your veins
The blood on your hands
So stop it, you're fucking hurting her
Can we forget about the places that we should be?
We don't have to go home today
I'll sleep on a million couches
If we have to, to keep us both safe
Until we can take back
The years they've stolen from us
We'll always live like we're
Hopeless kids
But when
We're with all our friends
Can we just pretend
That no one can hurt us?
Cause hey
I love you, OK?
It's so hard to say
That I fucking need you too
Tonight
When they close their eyes
Look up to the sky
And climb up the moonlight
It's ours
The moon and the stars
They'll forget who we were
And we'll be together again
Sleep til the sun sets
Sleep til the sun sets
Sleep til the sun sets
The summer sun sets
I can't take the pressure
Yeah, everybody thinks that you just need to grow up
I know it's hard it's fucking impossible
Tryna make sense of the things that you feel now
With spiro and estro from Vanuatu
What the hell do you think that'll do to you?
I won't say she even though I know you want me to
I know that it's hard but I swear I still love you
I can't take the pressure
Cry on the bathroom floor when you look in the mirror
Cover your neck or they'll cut your head off
J you're only cute with your hearteyes and legs crossed
Write the things you think when you're out of your body
Run yourself out of words to say you're hopelessly lonely
And don't leave the city and don't leave the covers too
I know it's hard but I swear I still love you
I am never gonna understand
I am never gonna understand
I am everything you think about her
Behind her back, the whole truth
Does it hurt to say you love her like a son?
The world could kill her just cause she can't fit in right
Yeah! They'll make it so dangerous
When they leave no room to breathe in the space they carved out for us
When they get inside your head, give you white lies and black eyes
When they try to change your shape until your sense of self dies
But you make me feel like I'm out of my body
We ran out of words to say we're hopelessly lonely
So don't leave the city, please don't leave the covers too
Just stay right here babe, let's live life like lovers do
I am never gonna understand
I am never gonna understand
I am everything you think about her
Behind her back, the whole truth
Does it hurt to say you care about your son?
The world could kill her just cause she can't fit in right
You take spiro and estro from Vanuatu
You say you won't think about nothing but loving you
We're sleeping harbor seals on the seaside of Malibu
OK I won't think about nothing but loving you
Spiro and estro from Vanuatu
You say you won't think about nothing but loving you
We're sleeping harbor seals on the seaside of Malibu
OK I won't think about nothing but loving you too
I'm tired of failing
It's makin' a hole
In my heart and in my head
I've finally lost all control
I quit my job for this but nobody gives a shit
So this year will be my last of playing shows
You claim you're DIY, but you don't wanna die, die, die
Every time you see the word "millennial"
Oh, we're entitled
But I'm sleepin' on tile
And eatin' cold raviolis at the show

I've got somethin' to say:
I think your friends are fake
They're taking pictures of their plate while I'm eatin' my
While I'm eatin' my cold raviolis at the show

I've got somethin' to say
I think your friends are fake
They're taking pictures of their plate while I'm eatin' my
While I'm sleepin like
While I'm takin time, try to realize
Because how could I
Ever be the guy
To have his life
Work out fine?
You complain about your major, that you don't know what to do
I know exactly what I want, but it'll never come true
L.M.S, retweet, your life is a performance piece, your audience is fast asleep
'Cause you are boring, just like me

I need what you need
But way more than you think
I need what you need
But way more than you think
I need what you need
But way more than you think
I need what you need
But way more than you think
I've been talking so much shit
On myself in my own head
I know it does no good but I still do
And if I get 1 chance
To end my life for real
I won't wince
'Cause maybe if I died right now I would be a great man

I've been thinking a lot

About how my friends are gone
And it's not their fault that I'm never around
Those things are all that I want
I'm all that I've got
Right now I'm all that I've got
You'd think from the past that I've learned a lot
But I'm so damn lost

And the way that I work is just like everyone else
But I don't wanna think that so I destroy my health
I am invincible!
I'm a sad little man

I'm a sad fuckin man
I should just flip my van
So I can die alone with the things I love
My guitar and my amp
That's why I play this song
In hopes someone sings along
So you can share my pain
Let's connect our brains
And be two broken halves
Let's be broken

I'm just a sad little man
Don’t say, don’t say things will get better cause they won’t
They won’t, they’ll stay bad forever
And the people you love will die
Everyone that you love will die
Don’t say, don’t say things will get better cause they won’t
They won’t, they’ll stay bad forever
And the people you love will die
Everyone that you love will die
And they'll never come back no they won't (they won't)

I never thought that I would ever be old enough to worry about life and stuff
And how to pay for bills and such
I don't want to say (it's a rude awakening)
'Cause I'm doing just fine (but man, this shit is everyday)
And I know everyone agrees that life is too much, but also everyone knows that not livin' is no fun
So stay home and play games today (hangout with your friends real late)
While you still can (still can)

Don’t say, don’t say things will get better cause they won’t
They won’t, they’ll stay bad forever
And the people you know will die
Everyone that you know will die
So quit saying that you feel so blessed
Because from the moment you were born, you were cursed for death
You're like me
I'm like you

And all the places that you'll ever go
And all the people that you'll ever know
Hold them tight to you
And when they leave, never let that feeling loom
And all the places that you'll ever go
And all the people that you'll ever know
Hold them tight to you
And when they leave, never let that feeling loom
And all the places that you'll ever go
And all the people that you'll ever know
Hold them tight to you
And when they leave, never let that feeling loom
And all the places that you'll ever go
And all the people that you'll ever know
Hold them tight to you
And when they leave, never let that feeling loom

I'd say, I'd say things would get better
But if I did, I know they'd never
Being happy seems like a lie
That we believe but don't know why
Soon the ones you love will start falling away
And the friends that you have never stay the same
And your memories will start distancing
Themselves from the place you keep everything
And when it's time for final goodbyes
I hope we can look the ones we love straight in the eyes
This is what life is all about
This is what life is all about
This is what life is all about
Death is what life is all about
I'm sitting outside
Drinking all alone
Is this all I want?
Is this all I know?
Will you forgive me when I'm a piece of shit?
Cause I'm nearly tired
Apologizing for it
Wake me up with your love
Sorry I suck but it's all I know
Forgive me when
I'm too spent
I'm still trying hard
You're always there when I need you
Always waiting for me
I can't help but feel guilty
That you have never been ignoring
The texts the calls that I put through to your phone
And All the nights that I've left you home all alone
The faces that we make and every single joke I take for granted without you I wouldn't have it
Remember that night I was up crying in bed
Thinking about where we go when we're dead
I never shed tears like that guess I'm still growing
I'm just afraid I'll lose these moments
Wake me up with your love
Sorry I suck but it's all I know
Forgive me when
I'm too spent
I'm still trying hard
You're making me sick
You're making me anxious
I wish I could think of some reference to tie in my head
Is coming under distress
Why can the kids who sat and judged me
Now cling to all their lovely little things
And claim they've always been saints
I don't buy a word they say, I don't buy it
So crawl back into a hole
And convince yourself you're so lovable
You're all so good at that
So crawl back into a hole
And convince yourself you're so lovable
You're all so good at that

My father's father died before him
And his father's father before
I'd hate to break the chain
There's nothing complex about my traits
History projects I'll die alone and overweight, not a mistake
You think you're better than me?
I swear I could cut off my whole family
Always loved them, but definitely always more concerned about my well being
Know what I mean?

I'm not the article you share without reading the whole page
Every detail about me is grueling and I hope to keep it that way
So set the stage then dim the lights cause I wanna make this Dramatic to add validity to all the feelings I'm left with

And as these thoughts rattle in my brain
For what seems like my whole life
I'll never get a grasp on what my family could have been like
It's all so repetitive
Am I ready for the death of it?
Grandma you're dead and you'll always will be sorry
Dad didn't respect you, you know it kills me
Your husband's still alive and yeah he's losing his mind bit by bit
I think dad feels it, mortality and regret and I can feel it too
Waiting for it
Come tomorrow, I'll be on my way back home
In the morning, call from a roadside telephone

One night doesn't mean the rest of my life
If I go, it's not impossible
But possible is probably wrong
So let go, 'cause I'm afraid to try
Keep my hands by my side

I won't come back
I hope some day, you understand
I want to try, and make it right
But don't know if I can

Last night, everything was right, the rain was gone
One summer night's the only time we've known
So shut your eyes
When you wake up, I'll be gone
When you wake up, I'll be gone

One night doesn't mean the rest of my life
If I go, it's not impossible
But possible is probably wrong
So let go, 'cause I'm afraid to die
What became of everyone I used to know?
Where did our respectable convictions go?
Your words don't match the story that your actions show
What do I know?

I'm sure you can't help but remembering
I thought that you'd be the one not to forget
Remembering's not helping you yet

Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
Maybe I can see you on holidays
You're worlds away
I've never forgotten all our yesterdays
I'm lucky if we're speaking on the holidays

The evidence presents itself accusingly
Your absence speaking everything you think of me
Now that I am faced with opportunity
You're not remembering

I'm not asking you anyway
And even if you ever could cave in
I wouldn't know where to begin

Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
Maybe I can see you on holidays
You're worlds away
I've never forgotten all our yesterdays
I'm lucky if we're speaking on holidays
Holidays
Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
I'm lucky if we're speaking on holidays
Holidays
Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears?
One at a time
An unspoken balance here
Unabridged for so many years
That I should stare at receivers
To receive her isn't fair

Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

Your arms in mine, any time
Wouldn't trade anything
You're still my everything
To my surprise
Before my eyes, you arrive

Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

Still breaking old habits, habits
You pulled the wool over me
I can see everything, everything
Remembering
Jinx removing

Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't worry, I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

No need for reminding
You're still all that matters to me
It's words you forget to Anniversary songs
The bottles bite back
Your tolerance wrong
Your good intentions count for little anymore
If you're sorry, why wage war?
I'm not fully convinced
There's something wrong with this
Could another point of view
Biased and untrue
Tear me away from you?

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
Apologies are breaking me
Constants aren't so constant anymore

Two days, I wait for calls to come through
Tonight for me translates to yesterday to you
Bend and you wave
You're barely away
I wish I could say tonight
When you bend and wave goodbye
You'd take me with you

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
Apologies are breaking me
Constants aren't so constant anymore
The constants aren't so constant anymore

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
(Constants aren't so constant anymore
Constants aren't so constant anymore)
(repeat)
You really think that you're bigger than this
To the tune of ten thousand lisps
Who'd have thought we'd represent
When I can't take a compliment?
Overexposure is the key
And any focus on me
Is appreciated
And it should be

No wonder now
I finally found
The right formula for...

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
You take it all too seriously

What better way to make an honest mistake
Than a televised hand of fate?
When the world closes in on you
A decision would be overdue
Now, nothing left is out of hand
A stronger, jaded man stands
If the world is ending
Then we toast to it

I'm stronger now
But not without
The right formula for...

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from me
Here's all you get from me

I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for?
I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for?
Wait for?
I wait!

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from me
Pale horse songs of a slow decline
Sideshow words if the songs don't mind
G-d gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water, is the H-Bomb next time?
Pale horse vows in a grave I-do-yes-definitely reply
Smile for the camera at a 'church' nearby
Threw a mute curse at the Boise sky
For my fucked up Napoleon-of-St.-Helena-hairline
Black horse leaping when the frogs withdrew
The parable of the plums where the olives grew
Clouded rearrangement of sounds we knew:
An Idaho sunset for my own private Waterloo
Pale horse songs of a slow decline
Side show words if our moms don't mind:
Cloud gave no one a rainbow sign--
Six-point starred ink flag next time?
שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד     قل هو الله احد الله الصمد
With imperial crowns we were 'sent,'
Riding out conquest-bent
Daylight is breaking
Weilding the sanctified sword
For the army of the Scarecrow Lord
Daylight is breaking
Balancing scales at our feet
Measuring out two pounds of barley, six pounds of buckwheat
Beasts of the Battersea Shield
At the opening of the fourth seal
The sky, I'd been told
Would roll up like a scroll
As the mountains and islands moved from their place
And the sun would turn black
As a dead raven's back
But there'd be nowhere hide
From the Judge's face
After which message-less birds take flight without cause
To the silence they've heard in the absence of laws
Or imperial crowns: Unsent, unsigned--
The other night I dreamt I was finally out of college
In my own pair of sandals, I had turned into my father
Whistling our tune about the Rio Grande
Like an anchorite in June I took hold of my own hand
And started on the Abrahamic joke we knew
About apostrophes and pronouns and you-remember-who
"But let's keep that silly punchline between me and you
Little Haroon
And the man in the moon."
Though by the path I lead
The passing of time and the pouring of tea
Are all I've lately seen
O my soul {SH 159}
Until the temporal bridge be burned
Until our anchor stocks hold firm
Where the hands of clocks don't turn
O my soul
May our lips remain discreet
While your traps are beneath our feet--
But how long before our tails are caught
By our quote-free-end-quote thought?
Sugar in the cane, candles low
Kettle on the flame for the teapot? No
I tremble at the thought
Sugar in the cane, candles low
Southside Flats where the upscale go
I tremble at the thought!
I tremble at the thought!
On the Streets of Mexican Wars
I battle with the memory of a first fight
In our contemptible youth
I quoted White Nights
("My God, a moment of bliss
Why, isn't that enough for a whole lifetimes?")
Thinking that'd get rid of you
And waited with a stone in my hand
But you were quite right:
Nature had another plan
(& failed to run it by me)
Nature had another plan
Some other surrogate self
To live in the sediment of so many somebody elses'
Innumerable lives and you were right:
It's not a person who dies
But worlds die inside us
Sugar in the cane and the candles are low
On the West End Bridge looking down at the Ohio
I tremble at the thought of what's often referred to as 'karma.'
The sugar and the candles are gone
You panic like a mouse when the lights go on
(I admit, it warms my heart
To watch your world fall apart)
The colorful hills talked me down from the bridge:
To heck with all the drugs my parents did
I'd like to meet whoever said the words we print in red
With a coin in my teeth on Mexican War Streets
Rivers of sadness and mutual need
In the loud desperation of social routine
Rock of salvation, lightly esteemed
Distance is surging like oceans between us
Suspended by strings
Over rotating wheels
Via magnets and springs
Of Carnegie steel
'Representation' our fashionable theme
And unfathomably powerful forces
Like oceans between us
We have all the signs we need
We decide not to read
"My will:"
And those who precede: the relation between
Is listening beside me
At night like some seismic machine
While the mental vibrations of petrified men
Are etched in translation by pendulum pens
And the movements of underground plates
Do nothing to bridge or exacerbate
Oceans between us
Today a thousand years
Of strained affection and prayer
"Out beyond ideas of right & wrong is a field"
Will I meet you there?
Will I meet you there?
The summer garden blooms
With autumn soon replaced
Another harvest moon—
So many ways to lose
So many faiths

"Holy to the LORD" on the bells of horses
Safely on the shore we sank like stones
To the bottom of a made up ocean

Standing on the lake shore, Julia
Silent as a seashell, Julia
Magnet of the elk park, Julia
Laid down on the temple floor
"Send a couple rats," said Julia
I'd have done the same thing to you
Coffee and a milk, now Julia
Who do you think needs who more?


In case your plan falls through
To mispronounce my name
(Static between me and that Salafi, Yusef)
To curse You-Don't-Know-Who
And bow before the same
(So was the scene at al-Aqsa.)
I'll meet you there
(I have to admit I loved the cut of his pant legs!)
I'll meet you there
(Another lovely afternoon for Sūrat al-Kāfirūn)

"Holy to the LORD" on the bells of horses
Safely on the shore we sank like stones
To the bottom of a made up ocean
In a sweater poorly knit and an unsuspecting smile
Little Moses drifts downstream in the Nile
A fumbling reply, an awkward rigid laugh
And I'm carried helpless by my floating basket raft
Your flavor in my mind swings back and forth between
Sweeter than any wine and bitter as mustard greens
And it's light and dark as honeydew and pumpernickel bread
The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead
Go plow some other field, and try and forget my name
We'll see what harvest yields, and, supposing I'd do the same
I planted rows of peas, by the first week of July
They should have come up to my knees
But they were maybe ankle high
Take the fingers from your flute to weave your colored yarns
And boil down your fruit to preserves in mason jars
But now the books are overdue and the goats are underfed
The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead
You're a door-without-a-key, a field-without-a-fence
You made a holy fool of me and I've thanked you ever since
If she comes circling back we'll end where we'd begun
Like two pennies on the train track the train crushed into one
Or if I'm a crown without a king, if I'm a broken open seed
If I come without a thing, then I come with all I need
No boat out in the blue, no place to rest your head
The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead
I do not exist, I do not exist, I do not exist
I do not exist, I do not exist, I do not exist
I do not exist, I do not exist, I do not exist
I do not exist, only You exist, I do not exist
"I do not exist,"
We faithfully insist
Sailing in our separate ships
And from each tiny caravel-
Tiring of trying, there's a necessary dying
Like the horseshoe crab in its proper seasons sheds its shell
Such distance from our friends
Like a scratch across a lens
Made everything look wrong from anywhere we stood
Our paper blew away before we'd left the bay
So half-blind we wrote these songs on sheets of salty wood
Caught me making eyes at the other boatmen's wives
And heard me laughing louder at the jokes told by their daughters
I'd set my course for land
But you well understand
It takes a steady hand to navigate adulterous waters
The propeller's spinning blades held acquaintance with the waves
As there's mistakes I've made no rowing could outrun
The cloth low on the mast like to say I've got no past
But I'm nonetheless the librarian and secretary's son
With tarnish on my brass and mildew on my glass
I'd never want someone so crass as to want someone like me
But a few leagues off the shore, I bit a flashing lure
And I assure you, it was not what I expected it to be!
I still taste its kiss, that dull hook in my lip
Is a memory as useless as a rod without a reel
To an anchor ever-dropped, seasick-yet-still-docked
Captain spotted napping with his first mate at the wheel
Floating forgetfully along, with no need to be strong
We keep our confessions long and when we pray we keep it short
I drank a thimbleful of fire and I'm not ever coming back
Oh, my God!
"I do not exist," we faithfully insist
While watching sink the heavy ship of everything we knew
If ever you come near I'll hold up high a mirror
Lord, I could never show you anything as beautiful as You
Lately, it's been getting late but I'm not tired
And no thanks to
Sleepless nights spent burning with desire
So I'll get in my car

We drove to the shoreline with the check engine light on
We slept in a spare room, sparing no thoughts for our friends
And we're all going straight to hell for all the lies we tell ourselves

Last night
Last night, I wanted to leave all my friends out
Desperate chance dragged me out of the sand
But chance's a certain way of getting stuck
On one small desperate action robbed me of all my good luck
Why did I think I could make it better now?
Why did I think I could keep my feet on the ground?

If I wake up and accidentally crawl into your arms
It's nothing personal, personhood has always seemed so strange
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same
If I freak out and crash my fucking car into your house
Of course it's personal, personhood has made me feel this way
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same

I'm getting too old for this shit
I'm throwing fits and acting like a kid again
Andy, the highway looked so dark
When the black took control of my eyes
When something made my focus smash
And I'll be back when the rest of it dies
The voice in my head was gone
Every sort of person looked like hell
With their hands in their pockets
And the marks on their scalp
If I get a chance to breathe
I couldn't breathe under all of that weight, and the things that we've seen.
With all the dead, with their hats on their chest, and their thoughts in the leaves.
I can't breathe
(The highway looked so dark
I'm drowning underwater)
Tear the fever out of my lungs, put the cold back under my tongue.
And it was cold in Essex County
When the old sat there side by side
Building tombs in the form of houses
Burying the rest of Old Joe's mind
And I can see them sitting
Aging into the light
Tucked into Someplace, Toronto
Saying, "why can't you be alive?"
And it got cold in Essex County
When he sat next to his grave
Screaming to nothing
If they could have just one more day
And all the drugs didn't help a thing
But fill his knees with epic pain
At the moment he let out a smile
Because at least he felt something
You wrote me off, I called it funny
Too troublesome, too tongue in cheek
I made friends with your distant presence
But by myself all I had was silence
Your cozy glare turned my eyes bloodshot
I missed you most when I could sleep
I know that my brother is better than he thinks he is, maybe we should call each other
And I'll sit on top this train, spread myself out and open the holes in my head
Spill out the contents of my brain, give them to Joe to bring him back from the dead
Give me another bottle, so I don't mash my teeth
I won't be another animal, but maybe that's what I need
Lord knows I've been tryin', but human ain't my thing
Maybe all those pretty Ativan will feel better inside my skin
Lighting my lighter in my pocket reminding me that I'm here
(Am I imaginary, or is my voice not loud enough?)
Sometimes, I'm awake
Thinkin' about
Fuckin' things up for myself again
So relax and sit there
My organs know I mean well
Even though they're all gone
But they're content

Drivin' up north
Headin' towards nothin'
Just for a fake laugh
And a stupid smile
I never asked to see
"Lost" painted on your forehead
Looking forward
It's been taunting
Me for a while

Sometimes, I'm in front of the street
Noticing my face in the paint
This is hell
This is far
This is human
This is something where no one
Ever gains

What's there to do
I couldn't even tell you
Everything keeps spinning
Letting me know
That something doesn't feel right
And it's sitting in my chest
Feelin' so low

It's been black outside
For days now
Hope the end of the week
Gets here quick
So there is nothing left to question
Not even the God that I told
To quit

Oh, I'm seein' the dreariness of this
Oh, I'm believin' now that I can't fix this
Oh, I'm seein' the dreariness of this
Oh, I'm believin' now that I can't fix this


Oh, I'm seein' the dreariness of this
Oh, I'm believin' now that I can't fix this
Oh, I'm seein' the dreariness of this
Oh, I'm believin' now that I can't fix this
"Hey," I said in my head
You told me to stop talking
My words stayed put obediently
And subsequently I'm tracing
The lines of my spinelessness tonight
I go past all of my half-heart starts
Words that fell apart
I get tangled up in loose-leaf thoughts
Rewrite them 'til they fall
And wallow in the thought
That I might not ever start
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Now
From pacing to facing
My problems, questions seem to haunt them
My habits, they persist
Constant reminders of my purposeless
I'm insignificant
But I don't remember anymore

I know all this will come to pass
Please god, just make it fast
I watched the door close as you left
And traces filled my head
So maybe
I've got a lot to tell you
Forgive me
I don't know where to start
So maybe
I've got a lot to tell you
Forgive me
I don't know where to start
Instrumental
Instrumental
Don't take this the wrong way
I know you can't relate
To feelings you don't have personally
I'll take what you said
And struggle to put your shoes over mine in my head
And use it to piece together my confidence
I can hardly breathe
So I'm scanning for space
That lends asymmetry
Where I'll put mind over matter
To put this matter out of my mind
'cause I shouldn't let this get to me
But I'm having trouble trying to find the right way
To say I feel less than confident
I'll put mind over matter
To put this matter out of my mind
'cause I shouldn't let this get to me
But I'm having trouble trying to find the right way
To say I feel less than confident
I’ve got a leak
Certainly it pushes thoughts behind my teeth
It fills the room around me
So light, its mess, it rises up
And hangs until it drops
Blanketing surroundings

I don’t feel like myself
Or anyone else

I don’t feel like myself
Or anyone else
I don’t feel like myself
Or anyone else

Prescribed to feel this way by oxygen
That I exhale as poison
Well, do I exhale this poison?
So if it seems like there’s no air to breathe
Or if the room’s collapsing
Well, you can blame it on me

My brain just can’t contain
The chemicals its made
My frame just can’t contain
The chemicals I take

I don’t feel like myself
Or anyone else
I don’t feel like myself
I've stowed away everything
In boxes and old spaces
Trying to keep my senses
The only place i want to be
Is listening to elvis in the front seat
Faking a life in the fifties
It's not that i lied
It's just hard to say that i tried
Ohh...
I just think that it's about time
That i stopped
Falling for every beautiful set of brown eyes
Just like your brown eyes
The only place i want to be is listening
To elvis in the front seat
Faking a life in the fifties
Ohh...
I just think that it's about time that i stopped
Falling for every beautiful set of brown eyes
Just like your brown eyes
Just like your brown eyes
Just like your brown eyes
After the rapture, I’ll take what’s mine
Because the blame for my faults lie in my design
I hope that you know
I hope that you know

I swore that I’d be better this time
But I’m more circle than a line

I’m no deity
But, goddamn, I might as well be
I’ll walk on water, too
And I when I do, I’ll sink him through

I swore that I’d be better this time
But I’m more circle than a line

When God dies, I’ll skip the funeral
When God dies, I’ll…
When God dies, I’ll skip the funeral
When God dies, I’ll…
When God dies, I’ll skip the funeral
When God dies, I’ll…
When God dies, I’ll skip the funeral
When God dies, I’ll…
I could spend a whole night staring at a screen
Just so I can brag that I haven't cried myself
To sleep in two whole years (in two whole years)
With hearts hardly beating we spent the furthest time waiting
Poetic scripts followed
By unfulfilling outcomes
Saved from drowning with a deep breath
A glass of ice water
Swallowed all at once
Intensity spoke calmly
Calamity over and over
We're laughing but we're not breathing
We're crying yet feeling nothing but
The dead air of an otherwise
Non-existent summer
And the cool breeze off an ocean
Spitting pleas of comfort
Right back in our face
And the cool breeze off an ocean
Spitting pleas of comfort
Right back in our face
If this is love then we have learnt nothing
If this is love then where is life meant to
If this is love then we have learnt nothing
If this is love then where is life meant to lead us
Except in circles
I wish I could have taken you up
On that offer for a ride from the airport
But the night skies in the east
Were bursting with red
So I thought that everything would be fine
In the morning
Too caught up in my own anxieties
To notice the western clouds
I guess we all make mistakes
Sometimes
A laugh is all we’ll ever need
And at times I still forget to smile
Airports aren’t the same
When you can’t drink at the bar
Life isn't the same
Without you around
Airports aren’t the same
When you can’t drink at the bar
Life isn't the same
Without you around

And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
Airports aren’t the same
When you can’t drink at the bar
Life isn't the same
Without you around
And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
And how I wish I could get over myself
Sometimes
And I'm pained and I'm dead
And I'm going to bed with wide open eyes again
And I'm pained and I'm dead
And I'm going to bed with wide open eyes again
I’ll up the ante by two years
And risk all I’ve got
For another chance with you
I can spend the whole night
Staring at a screen
Just so I can brag
That I haven’t cried myself
To sleep
In two whole years
In two whole years
I’ve been obsessing over empty words and dimes
Dropping pounds for cigarettes and hoping you really mean it this time
Amidst all the excitement
I still find time
To sleep past noon
So how much would you bet
That if I stare
At these words
I can change their meaning
These eyes don’t see the sun like they used to
(there’s nothing left of this teenage heart)
Dreams used to haunt me every night
(now I pray for nothing else)
Carry me back home in your limp arms
(show me the youth that I’ve forgotten)
Carry me back home in your limp arms
(two whole years)
One whole year
(since I thought of you last)
Two whole years
(I guess we’ll do this again)
Three whole years
(I'll take my chances)
Four whole years
(since I felt your lips)
I can't say that I've never fantasized about my own funeral and who would be there
The smell of industrial paint and magnolia
Fill the warm summer night air
We reminisce old meadows
Once full of life
Now they’re parking lots
Abandoned shopping carts
Crows picking at discarded wrappers
They were empty and pure
The world hints at our numbered days
And we revel in it
(Creating a perfect bubble to
Be ignorant in
Taking romance as a drug
It’s not only killing me)
We’ve created this crumbling fortress
Now we lie our bodies in this filth
Let it take over
Let it take over
Born in a field of wealth and gold
She didn't know it very well
Her brother and father left out in the cold
Fed grass with the pigs and the chickens and so
She sang her sad tune in her suitcase
Filled with pictures of gap toothed smiles
She fed her captors three times a day
They honoured her leader with slaps on the back
While her vision grew darker, imprisoned by life's cruel hand
When the war was over they packed up and left
Her scars in the kitchen, traumatized but alive
She met a man with dirty lungs
On a bike they road as three
Soon after, eleven mouths to feed
The man's lungs gave in
So she got on her knees and cleaned
So she got on her knees and cleaned
So she got on her knees and cleaned
So she got on her knees and cleaned
The children were unloving and ungrateful
They mourned their father with theft and abuse
And so
She fed her captors three times a day
They honoured her leader with slaps on the back
While her vision grew darker, imprisoned by life's cruel hand
While her vision grew darker, imprisoned by life's cruel hand
Now she's gone
In a home
In the west
All alone
Looking at the spot where you were yesterday
It’s like you vaporized through the bed frame
I knew that I would miss those late night ghost stories
But I had no idea it would keep me awake
Living in too many parking lots this week
It’s on one hand, but it’s more than it should be
Leaves scraping on the street, emulating bloody knees
Another night spent obliviously
But it’s hidden in plain sight
Yeah, it’s all right there in front of you
I couldn’t stay outside
But I couldn’t stand to lie next to you
Do I have a reason to ask you
Why you kept me from something new?
Well, I waited for nothing
Me from something new
I waited for nothing
Me from something new
I'm waiting for nothing
Me from something new
It’s hidden in plain sight
Yeah, it’s all right there in front of you
I couldn’t stay outside
But I couldn’t stand to lie next to you
And all your friends
I heard every single word you said
You and all your friends
I heard every single word you said
Said, said, said
This is the second night (straight)
That I've stayed inside
I should be getting ready but I'm watching Always Sunny
Declined your invite
But it's the first time and I'm asking myself

Subtract or add up?
To fall back or catch up?
Subtract or add up?
To fall back or catch up?

This is the seventh night (straight)
That I've stayed inside
I should be getting ready but I'm watching Mr. Meaty
Ignored your invite
But it's the last time that I'm asking myself

Subtract or add up?
To fall back or catch up?
Subtract or add up?
To fall back or catch up?

Shedding my layers cause I finally need to leave
This three month curse plagues everything that I used to be
Shedding my layers cause I finally need to leave
This three month curse plagues everything
Shedding my layers cause I finally need to leave
This three month curse plagues everything that I used to be
Shedding my layers cause I finally need to leave
This three month curse plagues everything that I used to be
It’s so amazing how much comes to life
And I wonder what the last thing you remember was
Was it scratching my back 'til I fell asleep?
Or was it pulling me apart 'til you made me leave?
Harry, you don’t even know me
Lately, I don’t even know myself
It’s not surprising how little we talk
And I wonder when our last good conversation was
Watching the motion detector light
That lit up your driveway as I stared into darkness
I’m feeling better than this
I’m feeling better than this
Harry, you don’t even know me
Lately, I don’t even know myself
But that’s okay
I’ll be fine if you’re fine
I’ll be there
I'll be there
Harry, you don’t even know me
Lately, I don’t even know myself
Harry, you don’t even know me
(Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
I don’t even know what the fuck to feel)
Lately
Waste your turn in line
We have all day to stay here
We just want to go home
Please let us go home
Lost my mind today and my wallet tomorrow
Cast a shadow on myself
Legs much weaker than before
Learned how to be when I went home
Summer's been fine
Winter’s around the corner
Autumn’s in the way
No one tried to warn her
Talk to me
Tell me all the things that you wanted to, but you couldn’t say
Now we have so much time, but we’re running out of breath
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back
Judging by your face
The most anyone’s cried today
Air conditioning blocks out everything
Talk to me
Tell me all the things that you wanted to, but you couldn’t say
Now we have so much time, but we’re running out of breath
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back
To hear something new is hard and painful for the ear
We hear the music of forigners badly
I make the sounds you can't understand
I make the sounds you can't understand
Thus spake me
My fingers, my voice, slide into every orifice
My fingers, my voice
This is my critique, this is my subversion
This is my revolution, this is my revolution
I make the sounds that you can't understand
I make the sounds that you can't understand
You, I... spake me
You, I own these words
This is friendship, that's what friends are for
You, I own these words
This is friendship, that's what friends are for
I am Nietzsche
Thus spake me
I am Nietzsche
I am Nietzsche
I am Nietzsche
I am Nietzsche
I am Nietzsche
I am Nietzsche
1886 was a very good year
And you know this to be true
Thus spake me
We smiled and said
"I'll see you this summer"
But we know that it was over
That's just what you say to someone who's dying
That's just what you say
This is to us
Our hands fit, at least for a while
This is to us
Our hands fit
I miss the face, I miss the taste, I miss the
I miss the face, I miss the taste, I miss the
I miss the face, I miss the taste, I miss
I miss the face, I miss the taste
I'm sorry about it all, I'm sorry about it all
It's all my fault
All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
Don't even try to fake it
All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
Don't even try to fake it, don't even try
I'm here because I was ready to leave
This should mean more but it can't
All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
Don't even try to fake it
All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
Don't even try to fake it, don't even try
I'm here because I was ready to leave
This should mean more but it can't
I'm here but I was ready to leave
This should mean more but it can't
So dance, dance, dance to the sounds
Of America's best dressed fake out
I was here but I was ready to leave
This should mean more but it can't, can't
So dance, dance to the sounds
To the sounds, so dance
To the sounds of America's best dressed fake out
I kiss the girls that speak Marcuse
I kiss the boys that speak Foucault
I love the kids that know Adorno
And snub their nose at kids who don't
I make love in theory and touch myself in practice
What's good for the posture is good for the pose
Who let the Tigers out to kill all the lovers?
You are, you are, you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
And you are, you are, you are, you are
And you are, you are, you are, you are
And you are, you are, you are, you are
And you are, you are, you are, you are
I am your warm body, how bad does it hurt?
I am your warm body, how bad does it hurt?
I feel nothing but you breathe through me, through you
I feel nothing but you breathe through me, through you
It passes through me
Slides off like rain, slides off like rain
Breath through me, breathe through you
Breath through me, breathe
You bite my lip when we kiss, it bleeds and I fall in love
You bite my lip when we kiss, it bleeds and I fall in love
You are, you are, you are, and you are
You are, you are, you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
You are, you are, you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, and you are, and you are
And you are, and you are, you are, and you are
How does the world perceive me perceiving myself?
All I care to do is sip on beer and chocolate milk
I’m frightened more than usual, lately
I do not translate into ”one of the boys”
”Lotus flower” or ”chinita”
I'm just ES
I'd probably rather nap than wonder, restlessly:
Will you ever be impressed by me?
Mom doesn't think I fit into the darling archetype
But that's an ancient pair of jeans
And my thighs are crafted holy rolling thunder
Forget the numbers, forget the numbers please
Every goddamn family reunion
Someone's got something to say
How did you become this way?
As if I’ve made a mistake
Meanwhile, they’ve slaughtered the cake
Pearly
White mystery appeared before my eyes
Wriggling in the kitchen sink
In and out the bowl of fresh-picked
Berries
How suddenly I tried to flush them out
Water wasn’t strong enough
I just pretended that it was
If you want it, girl, go and get it
Pick the wound despite all that they say to you
What’s there to lose in making a move?
So, I washed my hands and took a hearty bite
Oh, how I got-
Oh, how I got so-
Finally
The mystery appeared before my eyes
Hearing her play in the grass
I took the marble from my hat to
Bury
Alone, I dug a hole into the dirt
My heart wasn't strong enough
I just pretended that it was
If you want it, girl, go and get It
Even if the pain is undeniable
Moving to lose, is making a move
So, I packed my bags and bought a ticket out
Oh, how I got-
Oh, how I got so-
If you “get it,” girl, do you want it?
Understanding and feeling are different
What’s there to lose if you’ve already lost?
So, I took my seat in the back of the car
Oh, how I got so small
Like a wool in the wash
Oh, how I got so small
Like a wool in the wash
Spit in the water, not sure why
My feet are sweating as this neck cranes
Downward, in search of where I went
Tried to leave a piece of me there in case I forget
From the dark it appeared
A splendid mystery, oh, it drew me near
Towards a path far from home
And I knew I had to go forth alone
Deep in the heart of this lone bridge
A sudden terror overtook me
Continue blindly or turn back
At risk of burdening the wood and rope I’d already passed?
Somehow I fought
Back against uncertainty
The harsh bite of jealousy
Prayers she had sent for me
To embark upon
Something they had never done
Out of fear
Fear of pain
But keeping static felt exactly the same
From underneath, the dark waves riled
After a wind blew by, removing
A pair of glasses from my face
And it occurred to me it wasn’t worth just staying in place
Slipping through the elevator doors well aware
That- that- that the man could be already there
Will he look?
Must I always come and go in distress?
I forget
I can’t escape behind the shape of my chest
And as a matter of fact
Either way I serve it
I am bound to a trap
Of two determined landscapes
So I’m bound to attack like a river:
Reflect, disconnect, deliver
All I’ve wanted for the place I live
Is the same for this vessel I’m in
A body of water, whole, alone, and free
Feeling nothing, it will pool inside of me
Resting my hands after I fought
To resurrect what I forgot
New hands appeared before my eyes
To move the dirt again
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
How suddenly there was a door
Now, when I look in the mirror
It’s not as hard to tell myself
The good things that I want to hear
But the problem slips from foul lips
And the misunderstanding of an ownership
Family doesn’t mean you can touch
And “just joking” is not a reason enough for me to
Not bite but be polite
And if you don’t see it coming
Then you better think twice
All I’ve wanted for the place I live
Is respect for this vessel I’m in
A body of water, wild, immense, untamed
Teach me how to be unseen as something to claim
Just when I thought I had run into a standstill
How suddenly there was a door
(If you don’t want it, you can reset it)
Here it comes, a current
Can you feel it rushing through
(If you don’t want it, you can reset it)
Despite all its power, I’ve learned it’s best
To shut my mouth and yet
(If you don’t want it, you can reset it)
The pressure will come
Enough with exposition
(If you don’t want it, you can reset it)
Get to the heart of it, no matter
What you started with
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
I just keep coming out to myself
I just keep coming out to myself
It just keeps coming
In the beginning: A promise
To take a shot in the dark
A pledge to rising and to falling apart
It was written
By our own hands
We were bound
Nervous and full of fire
We bore the task
That motions forward
While I keep reeling back
And though I try to revive it
Try to return to the start
Searching for us in the basement
Sifting for us in the car
I have a hard time with leaving
Time can't preserve every truth
So, what was once in existence
Must've turned into something else
Victories traded for losses
Don’t make up
For the weight
Or the space
That saves an emptiness I tried to replace
And though I try to revive it
Try to return to the start
Searching for something familiar
Do I misremember the past?
I have a hard time with leaving
Time can’t preserve every truth
Sever the stems of expecting
Light can fall and still follow through
Remind me
(Remind me)
Remind me
(It was na-na-not so great)
Full speed to a future of self-medication and poor understanding
Of everything you wasted four years in learning
The future, the future, the air's fucking burning!
And sleep, I can't sleep. I did some funny things with my best friend Patrick
This is a song that will most likely bore you
This is a song that will most likely put you to sleep
Oh my
My god
Why do I stay up late just to wake up late and feel lousy?
If that's the thing, if that's everything, why can't I stop?
Another empty hearted notion gone to shit, but it belongs in shit
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
WHHHHYYYYYYY
I've been wasting all this fucking year on
The idea of getting up and moving on
But I wait around, just emptying bottles
In the basement of the Slovak center on my side of town
It's a major fucking bummer
Because I feel nothing like my father
He's been sleeping underground
Don't wait around
'Cause there's nothing there at all, there's nothing but the end
You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)
So I'll just stay home
(I'm talking to you)
You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)
You're fucking gone
Gone, gone
I feel nothing
Like my father
He's been sleeping
Underground
Why are my eyes always shifting away from anyone,  everyone else's eyes?
A minor case; major depressive, a fantastic film score
My father's bike; my weight descending, with nothing to wait for
Then I push my hair back, then I mess it up
Then I bite my tongue from singing what you'll all say
"You swore that you would live your life without regret. Well, what do you wait for?"
Melissa, I fucked up
I won't cut my arms off, that won't keep me warm at night. And I'll do my best to live my life without regret
So when did cigarettes start cluttering your hands?
I ponder this some nights alone when I undress
And what do you do with those boys I see you with
Or better yet, what would I do if you came back?
I'd say no, or I hope I could, but I still want you
I hope that I die, I die, oh
And what do you think I would do after you left?
Would I stay sober? I think it'd be much worse, oh
I'd cut my arms off, I'd cut my arms off
I'd cut my arms off, I'd cut my arms off, I'd cut them off
No regeneration, regeneration, regeneration
I saw you standing there and well I, well I
I can't be trusted
I'm lost without a reason
But I think I could love you if only you would stop
Staring at me
When the sentences I make don't turn out right
I cannot handle it
No, don't take it as an insult
I only wish you were staring at me
When I roll over because I can't sleep at night
Or when I'm smiling because there's snow falling outside
Or when the brakes lock and we're clearly gonna die
I'm gonna grab your arm and scream "I love you!"
I hope you know that I'll love you
I know i signify more to you than stability alone
Like august in a midwestern state:
Full of grace and half-broken bones
You're falling over your own unfortunate songs
You can soak in all the sun you want, but it won't burn away your home
You're so close to changing forever and i'm too close to my family to notice
This year had better make me a new man
This liar could reach out and find me
I don't look up to enough local heroes…
I still don't feel inspired enough to change
You'll leave me more than a martyr would ask for
With civil service and my conscience to blame
I'm sorry I made you lose focus
I didn't think you slept enough to dream
Of a never-ending need to follow and a never-ending need to try and persuade me
How many times can you sit at home alone
And listen to that same old record and not get tired?
I've made more friends doing this than I could ask for
I've made more friends doing this than I care for
I just want you to grow up
Move and support something else
I just want you to grow up
Move and support someone else
I wanted to become a writer
I wanted to become a writer
You told me you were thinking of moving some place warmer
I told you I was thinking of staying right here
My friendships grew too
My friendships moved too
Did you think twice?
Are you going to need more?
Cause I'm halfway through my twenties, and I still can't get it
At what point does it become depressing?
And at what point does it get good again?
Last summer, I went on tour with my best friends, and it didn't help me
It didn't help me get over it
Get over it
And I could walk out through the streets for hours
But I'd still end up in the same bed
Drowning with mine
With some question of conquest and how it always relates to me and mine
And how you always end up disappointing someone
It takes more than a steady hand to help guide me
It takes more than prescription pills to bring me back
How nothing's ever right with you
How nothing turns out anywhere near how you planned it
With all I have saved I could buy you
To be proud, in the end, is still pride
And that's selfish
You remind me of instability
To be warm isn't everything you wanted from us
You remind me of instability
This isn't helping
You'll find me fair and unanswered
You will find me dressed in the best of the north end
What's the furthest place from here?
It hasn't been my day for a couple years
What's a couple more?
And if I go, don't forget the one good thing I almost did
I learned your name without words
I used my eyes, not my hands

What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck
And still walk away, all limbs intact?
And when I go, you'll be there
Crying out, begging me
I won't hear
I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall
I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love
And still smile to your new found friends?
In the same confusing breath
You pull away and draw me in
I wanted you, you wanted more
I built this life and now it's mine

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall
I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left


A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall
I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left
"You're not punk and I'm telling everyone."
Save your breath, I never was one
You don't know what I'm all about
Like killing cops and reading Kerouac

My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out when you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk? What's the score?

Got a friend, her name is Boxcar
Cigarettes and beer in El Sob
Her hair was blue, now it's green
I like her mind, she hates the scene

My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out when you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk? What's the score?

You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
It gets loneliest at night
Down at the liquor store
Beneath the neon sky
Our moonlight
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice
The pan's dried up so tight
With hardened beans
We're hungry
So I lean on you sometimes
Just to see you're still there
Your feet can't take the weight of one
Much less two, we hit concrete
How were we born into this mess?
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby
We were run out on a rail
Fell from the wagon to the night train
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
Cigarettes, they fill the gaps
In our empty days
In our broken teeth
We're jonesing
Say mister, can you spare a dime?
Some change could make a change
Could buy some time
Some freedom
Or an ear to hear my story, it's all I've got
My fiction beats the hell out of my truth
A palm upturned burnt blue
Don't call it sunburn
You've been shaking on the job
Just one drink ahead of your past
There's a white light coming up
You draw the blinds, hoping it'll pass
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
Boat on a hill, never going to sea
Anchored to a fixer upper's dream
This boat is beat, never gonna be a boat now
Thirsty, sees the sea from high on the ice plant

He keeps patching it and painting
Thinking about his pension plan
But the boat is out to pasture
Seems it never had a chance

I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
Begin again

Boat remembers the carpenter's sure hand
Missing fishy flutter on its rudder
Sold at an auction, on a dolly ever since
Sometimes rainy days drop boyish wonder

He keeps patching it and painting
Thinking about his pension plan
But the boat is out to pasture
Seems it never had a chance

I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
Begin again
Flattered that you think I warrant ugliness
Gutters drain west, mud made a mess of us
It's time to leave this place

I'd saw through your wrist to find a better trap that fits
I'd saw through your traps to find a better you
A part of you that lasts
I saw through your trap and into my own wrists
Saw we were through, red ribbons spill to blue
A sight to sore your eyes

I got this dress I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

Hair in the blood
Fly in the disappointment
Rubber, I'm glue
I'll write the book on you
It's sticking to my face

You need a little less than what you take for granted
This is the sip that's drinking back from you
Blacking out your eyes
You need a little more suppression of your appetites
This is your honeymoon, in separate rooms
It's neither sweet, nor bright

I got this dress I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess
I call it "sluttering" it means as little as your little test
You are your worst revenge, your very means, they have no ends
This is a story you won't tell the kids we'll never have

If you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough
If you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough
Your hair pinned up in circles
Worn like a widow to second the motion of second nature
Like two rafts knotted and you're knotted and still where sound is lost and found
But I fear it's all just coming back to me
And I fear that it's all just coming back
It's all coming back, It's all coming back to me
Under that threat of sky we lie together
Why care about the weather?
It only ends - it ends in darkness

You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba da ba bap
Do do do do do do do do and you -
You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do do do do do do do do do do -

And between 19, 19 and 40
For the tea it will have changed me
And turning from the invading light on my -
My naked room, my naked room
Our coffee stains and dusty coughing

You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba da ba bap
Do do do do do do do do and you -
You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do do do do do do do do and you
Nothing feels good like you in red and blue jeans
And your white and night things
And your white and night things
Nothing feels good like you in red and blue jeans
And your white and night things
And your white and night things
Delaware are you aware of Air Supply and Television
Are you still there is this thing on, am I coming down
Delaware where are you where are you from Philadelphia
Are you awhere are you tonight are you
(Do you remember the 70's or the 17's)?
I don't know East Texas from Louisiana
And I don't know Alabama
Or where Atlanta lies, where Atlanta is tonight
And Indianapolis summers in park and recreation pools
And carsick vacations in size eleven
In "I'm going to heaven" shoes
And I don't know God
And I don't know anyone
And I don't know God
And I don't know if anything at all
Will be all right
I don't know Billy Ocean, I don't know the ocean floor
I don't own any albums, I don't know anything
I don't go to college anymore
I don't know God
And I don't know anyone
And I don't know God
And I don't know if anything at all will be all right
I've got my hands on the one end
And I don't know where to put them
All trees are oaks
And all birds are blue
In the mountains of a magnet
And the mountains of you
I'm proud of my genius just like a painter
And dumb like a poet I think I can, I think I can
Just say it from the throats
From the throats of our wrists
With full sets of teeth
Vanilla almond teeth
From vanilla almond tea spent afternoons
Spent afternoons
Measuring time in spoons

Where forget-me-nots and marigolds
And other things that don't get old
That don't get old
But between one June and September
You're all I remember
But I'm a lantern, my head a moon, I married a room
I married a room
All trees are oaks
And all birds are blue
Well ach' du
What's 80 miles in Canada or 18 years in mountain time
Time
A southern run for a late longing to drink
Where all trees are oaks and all birds are blue
Well ach' du
And all trees are oaks and all birds are blue
Ach' du
I thought everyone was you

Where forget-me-nots and marigolds and other things
That don't get old
Don't get old
But between one June and September
You're all I remember
But I'm a lantern, my head a moon, I married a room
I married a room where I'll at least keep my hands in order
Where forget-me-nots and marigolds and other things
That don't get old
Don't get old
But between one June and September
You're all I remember
But I'm a lantern, my head a moon, I married a room
I'll keep my hands in order
And what about the air, the air, lying awake
What about the air, the air, lying awake
Tasting you in rain, I walk down to the train
Try not to look down
This day could someday be an anniversary
Everything is light and sound
Facing forwards, going slowly, wait for you to show me
Where this train wants to go
Living by the hour, I stop for every flower
Everything is soft and slow
Now all these tastes improve
Through the view that comes with you
Like they handed me my life
For the first time, it felt right
Thank you for making me see there's a life in me
It was dying to get out
Holding you, we make two spoons beneath an April moon
Everything is soft and sweet
This cigarette, it could seduce
A nation with its smoke
Crawling down my tired throat
Scratches part of me that's purring
Softly stirring
I'm a captain of industry, smoking famously
Feet up on the windowsill
Looking at all these trees I feel affinity with
Everything so soft and still
Budding at my fingertips
Touching you, I start to bloom
Alive with trains and passing ships
Soft and sweet along your lips now
I go "oh wow"
Thank you for taking me from my monastery
I was dying to get out
With tears of gratitude, I like my latitude
Cross town train to you
Now all these tastes improve
Through the view that comes with you
Like they handed me my life
For the first time, it felt worth it
Like I deserved it
Candle is blue, could see me through, I'm color blind
They tell me it's blue, I'm a believer, that's why I'm blind
Live on the freeway, listen to signs and we drive by feel
Be a believer, believe everything, you'll be right half the time
Candle is waxing, takes my apartment, I bask in its magic
All of the firefighters put out my fires, took all my matches
Staying up later, waking up old and I'm leaving her never
Ordering in, all friends and lovers and we're making our weather with a lone light bulb
I'm tired of fighting, so I'm demolished - that's the way
Some make exhaustion a mode of expression and that's their way
I'm just a question knowing my answer, I hope I'm wrong
I know the answer, it's four in the morning, I'm right again, I'm Chinatown
Now in a hurry, rubbing up urgent to get home to dot
Was my missed mistress, messed up my mattress, I missed the catch
Last of the pitchers, catfish done hunting, Harry Lundt
Most of the killers never get famous and it's hard on everyone
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
The curtain's a sea anemone
In the way it sways to the slow breeze
I lie spread out on the floor, looking at these things
Most of them are yours
And it's so nice
Sitting very still
Without those old shoes
I could never fill
Starfish with its arms out in a daze
Staring at the stars through an ocean haze
Was I one you wished upon, burned out like a light bulb
When you turned me on
And it's so nice
Sleeping here all alone
With my ashtray
White courtesy telephone
Now I'm making out the shapes
Like the shower rod, can it take my weight?
I will tell you I am fine
I got some news, friend, feels like I'm dying
Turtle on its back in the desert sea
And you look like a cool drink just slightly out of reach
Draw myself into the shell
Waiting on a sign from God or a nod from hell
And it's so nice
Sitting very still
Without those old shoes
I could never fill
Now we're turning on the lights
It's the first day of my second life
Take my name off of the lease
You can even keep the name, it never suited me
I live in a hotel, I must keep writing
If I'm to be better than everyone else
Like figure skating, like asphyxiating
On your own seeping fumes, you're just waiting
Living in a hotel, I'm not traveling
Between two points, in midair I'm levitating
Above the earth, beneath the sky, with eyes like static
In my three feet from bed to wall sleeps a genius
Leave me here to my devices
The call could come at any time
They're playing love songs on the radio tonight
I can't relate to that right now
Note to self, no one cares, your voice is average
In worried piles I typed for miles, you just stood there
I will begin, I will put right this morning terror
I have been kissed between the ears with human error
Leave me here to my devices
I need a word to change my life
I've tied my ankles to the table legs with wire
He can't write so much as type
Leave me here to my devices
I can't think with all this noise
They're playing love songs on your radio tonight
I don't get those songs on mine
You keep fucking up my life
You keep fucking up my life
You keep fucking up my life
You keep fucking up my life
Morning new disease, charcoal in bed
Bone soaked, anemic, listen in horror
To the scraping of flatware and china
And saran wrap to stifle libido
Air shaft, a chasm, their lives flung open
Sickness is a time for hating your neighbors
In their milk flats with five kids too many
Having day sex because they're all daughters
And you're thinking the same two things
Over and over again
I am dreaming of a life, I am dreaming of waking up
There's this anger rising cancer in me, standing like a wall
Between the waking world I seek and this infected plane of sleep
Love, come like an axe to all this ice and set me free
There's a black rewarding book beneath this stiff sheet if you look carefully
Noise, police, white hearse, TV air wave methadone
Diet, contact, safe sex, antibiotic
For your safety we've taken sharp objects
It's their object to keep you from waking
Taste test serenade, we dig the grave
Lose weight astrologically, no money down
For your enjoyment we've excised the dialog
For your protection we've installed this camera
Just keep thinking the same clean thoughts
And keep telling yourself it's alright
I am dreaming of a life and it's not the life that's mine
In a stolen car I rocket west out past that Jersey line
And the robots in their riot gear glimmer in my rear view mirror
Love came like an axe and had her way with this coarse earth
And a rich deserving book, she was recovered and understood and I awoke
And if I could swim
I'd swim out to you in the ocean
Swim out to where you were floating
In the dark
And if was blessed
I walk on the water you're breathing
To lend you some air for that heaving
Sunken chest

'Cuz they chose you
As the model
For their empty little dreams
With your new head
And your legs spread
Like a filthy magazine
And they hunt you
And they gut you
And you give in

And if I was brave
I'd climb up to you on the mountain
They led you to drink from their fountain
Spouting lies
And I'd slay
The horrible beast they commissioned
To steer me away from my mission
To your eyes

And I'd stand there
Like a soldier
With my foot upon his chest
With my grin spread
And my arms out
In my bloodstained Sunday's best
And you'd hold me
I'd remind you
Who you are
Under their shell

I'd walk through Hell, for you
Let it burn right through my shoes
These soles
Are useless without you
Through Hell, for you
Let the torturing ensue
My soul
Is useless without you

And if they sent a whirlwind
I'd hug it like a harmless little tree
Or an earthquake
I'd calm it
And I'd bring you back to me
And I'd hold you
In my weak arms like a first born

I'd walk through Hell, for you
Let it burn right through my shoes
These soles
Are useless without you
Through Hell, for you
Let the torturing ensue
My soul
Is useless without you
(Through Hell for you)
Without you
(Through Hell for you)
Without you
(Through Hell for you)

Now I've walked through Hell, for you
What's an adventurer to do
But rest these feet at home with you?
When I watch you, wanna do you
Right where you're standing (Yeah)
Right on the foyer, on this dark day
Right in plain view (Oh, yeah)
Of the whole ghetto
The boots stomp meadows
But we ignore that (Yeah)
You're lovely, baby
This war is crazy
I won't let you down
Oh, no, no

No
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Hell no, no, oh no
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Hell no, no

No
Oh, no no no!

And when our city, vast and shitty
Falls to the axis (Yeah)
They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings
Wallets and rings (Oh, yeah)
But Ms. Black Eyeliner
You'd look finer with each day in hiding (Oh, yeah)
Beneath the wormwood
Oooh, love me so good
They won't hear us screw away the day
I'll make you say

No (Alive!)
I won't let them take you
Won't let them take you
(Alive! Alive with love, alive with love tonight)
Hell, no, oh no (Alive!)
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
(Alive! Alive with love)
Hell no, no (Alive with love tonight)

Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love!
Treblinka, alive, with the glory of love, yeah!

Okay, speed it up. Go!

Should they catch us
And dispatch us
To those separate work camps
I'll dream about you
I will not doubt you
With the passing of time (Oh, yeah)
Should they kill me
Your love will fill me
As warm as the bullets (Yeah)
I'll know my purpose
This war was worth this
I won't let you down
No, I won't
No, I won't
No, I won't
(Alive! Alive!
Alive with love tonight)

(Alive with love tonight)
Hell no no, oh no (Alive! Alive!)
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
(Alive with love, alive with love tonight)
Hell no, no
No, no
If I die and go to hell real soon
It will appear to me as this room
And for eternity I'd lay in bed
In my boxers, half stoned
With a pillow under my head

I'd be chatting on the interweb
Maggots prey upon the living dead
I had no interest in the things she said
On the phone every day
I'll permanently hit the hay, hey

I called her on the phone
And she touched herself
She touched herself
She touched herself
I called her on the phone
And she touched herself
I laughed myself to sleep

At this rate
I'll be heading for electric chairs
I'm only human, with my cross to bear
When she described her underwear
I forgot all the rules
My rabbi taught me in the old shul

You're too young to be this empty girl
I'll prepare you for a sick, dark world
Know that you will be my downfall
But I call, and I call, and I call

I called her on the phone
And she touched herself
She touched herself
She touched herself
Called her on the phone
And she touched herself
I laughed myself to sleep

I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want
(Met you on the internet)
I don't know what I want
(Then I lied about it)
I don't know what I want
(Met you on the internet)
I don't know what I want
(Then I lied about it)

I called her on the phone
And she touched herself
She touched herself
She touched herself
Called her on the phone
And she touched herself
I laughed myself to sleep

(Woah!)
I called her on the phone
(Woah!)
And she touched herself
(Woah!)
She touched herself
(Woah!)
She touched herself
(Woah!)
Called her on the phone
(Woah!)
And she touched herself
I laughed myself to sleep
Admit it!

Despite your pseudo-bohemian appearance
And vaguely leftist doctrine of beliefs
You know nothing about art or sex
That you couldn’t read in any trendy New York underground fashion magazine
Prototypical non-conformist
You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store Gestapo
You adhere to a set of standards and tastes
That appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges (bullshit)
Giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art
Go analog baby, you’re so post-modern
You’re diving face forward into a antiquated past
It’s disgusting, it's offensive, don’t stick your nose up at me

Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself?
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself?
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah

You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends
Pontificating to each other
Forever competing for that one moment of self-aggrandizing glory
In which you hog the intellectual spotlight
Holding dominion over the entire shallow pointless conversation
Oh, we’re not worthy
When you walk by a group of quote-unquote normal people
You chuckle to yourself patting yourself on the back as you scoff
It's the same superiority complex
Shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell
And makes you a slave to the competitive capitalist dogma
You spend every moment of your waking life bitching about

Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself?
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
And I say yeah, what do you have to say for yourself?
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah

Cause I’m proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I’ve become
You’re free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my guitar
Proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I’ve become
You’re free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my guitar, yeah

Well let me tell you this, I am shamelessly self-involved
I spend hours in front of the mirror, making my hair elegantly disheveled
I worry about how this album will sell
Because I believe it will determine the amount of sex I will have in the future
I self medicate with drugs and alcohol to treat my extreme social anxiety

You are a faker (admit it)
You are a fraud (admit it)
Yeah, you’re living a lie (hey) living a lie (hey) your life is living a lie
You don’t impress me (admit it)
You don’t intimidate me (admit it)
Why don’t you bow down, get on the ground, walk this fucking plank (yeah!)

Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
And I say yeah (what do you..)

Proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I’ve become
You’re free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my
Guitar, guitar go!

I drift, drift, drift, drift, drift, yeah
I drift, drift, drift, drift, drift, yeah oh
And I am done with this
I wanna taste the breeze of every great city
My car and my guitar
My car and my guitar
So you'll come to be, made of these urges unfulfilled
Oh no, no, no, no, no
When I'm dead I'll rest
When I'm dead I'll rest, lay still
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
When the United States of genocide
Decided to break free
They instilled a huddled mass
Of neuroses in me
Or maybe it was Palestine
With that wretched German dwarf
Who carved the need to self-preserve
To pander and perform

Wish I were a woman for
Their struggle is noble
But culture shock is all I've got
I've worn it through it all
As I give in and integrate
The Matrix breaks me down
The kyke will denigrate himself
For the amusement of the crown

(Oh, oh)
I'm just a sick little Injun
(I am, I am)
Whose graves were razed by tank engines
(I am, I am)
I'm just an African import
(I am, I am)
Whipped and bound as an export
I'm the Hebrew

They say to be a minority
Is melting in their pot
But this soup is foul, I wear a scowl
And pine for what I'm not
We make the best comedians
But sadly it's no joke
Chop off the hand of Abraham
Before he slits my throat, oh, God, no


I am a waste of a bar mitzvah
And all of my חַיִּים I've been sad
Oy, a שלעמיל, a שלימזל
Buried underneath spires of Babel
I want to go back home


Pleased to meet you
I'm the Hebrew
Your sister thinks that I'm a freak
She's been ignoring my calls, we haven't spoken in a week
I get so drunk that I can't speak
Yeah, nothing's working and our future's looking bleak, and I say

Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up

I'm driving fast to get away
Doing one-eighty on the Don Valley Parkway
Yeah, I'd be better off dead
I don't give a shit, I just don't wanna die and I don't want to live, I said

Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up

I drink till I'm staring at the ceiling
I'll be just fine, I'm numb and losing feeling
I can't tell lies anymore

Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
I just don't know what to do
I'm still fucked up over you
She says that I drink too much
Hawaiian red fruit punch
She says I need to grow up
I was feeling a little bizarre
The day that I buried my family car
In the scrap metal wrecking yard
And I've said so many goodbyes
In the twenty-five years that I've been alive
And I don't know why this one was so hard
And every time when I go back to my apartment
All I wanna do is get stoned
And I'm sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet
And waking up all on my own so I brought you home
You started falling apart
Six months after you moved in
And I should have known from the start
That things would be different
It's not something that I can fix
If I could do anything, you know I would
If this fucking vacation would come to an end
Maybe then you'd be normal again
Last week, when I went back to my apartment
You were looking so stoned
The day after Christmas, you acted so different
You just wanted to be on your own
So I bought you medicine, went to the vet and
Cashed all of my savings and loans
But it was too late, you were letting go
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
And nothing I say will make it okay
You just sleep in the heat and repeat
You're wasting away
And nothing I do is gonna save you
I'm trying my best, but you can't even
Look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you
Yesterday, I went back to my apartment
To see how you've been holding up
You hadn't been eating, I thought you were sleeping, but
You're not waking up
And I want you to know that I'd spend every bit of my
Pitiful savings and loans
Just to see you again
But I know I won't
If this tour doesn't kill you then I will
I hate your guts and it makes me ill
Seeing your face every morning
One more month and twenty-two days
If this tour doesn't kill you, I may
Counting down the miles till we leave the state
I'm counting down the minutes 'til I can erase
Every memory of you
For a second, let's be honest
Nothing will clean your filthy conscience
Everything you do makes me wanna vomit
And if this tour doesn't kill you, buddy, I'm on it
Why can't we just get along?
Why can't we just get along?
Why can't we just get along?
Why can't we just get along?
You think you're so original
(Why can't we just get along?)
I can't wait for your funeral
(Why can't we just get along?)
Don't wish you were dead, I wish you'd never been born at all
(Why can't everybody just chill?)
I'm trying not to let you get in my head, but every line, every goddamn syllable
That you say makes me wanna gouge out my eyes with a power drill
If this tour doesn't kill you
If this tour doesn't kill you
If this tour doesn't kill you, then I will
Just like the kids, I've been navigating my way
Through the mind-numbing reality of a godless existence
Which, at this point in my hollow and vapid life
Has erased what little ambition I've got left
And I've embraced the calamity
With a detachment and a passive disinterest
Living out the back of my '97 Camry
Wondering how the hell I got myself into this

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothing but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothing
I don't care about nothing but you
No, I don't care about nothing

She said, "I'm sick of it all
Your little games are getting old
Your little songs are getting way too literal
How about some goddamn subtlety for a change?"
She said, "I feel like I've come untethered
In a room without walls
I'm drifting on the dark and empty sea of nothing
It doesn't feel bad, it feels like nothing at all"

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothing but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothing

And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given into my demons, oh


It's alright, it's just a flesh wound
You said you'd never saw it coming
I'm pretty happy lying here with you
It's pretty good to feel something

I don't care about nothing but you
No, I don't care about nothing
I don't care about nothing but you
No, I don't care about nothing

And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given into my demons, oh
And I had it maxed out (I had it maxed out)
And nothing is working (Nothing is working)
And everything's bleeding, oh
I don't even know why you're so pissed
You said I'm such a piece of shit
That wasn't subtle at all
Maybe I deserve more credit than you gave me
Say I'll never learn and it's never gonna phase me
It doesn't phase me at all

If I came home right now
What would I find out?

I'm at the end of my tether
You're under my skin and I'm letting it fester
Yeah, I've had enough
Stumble out and I'm headed for the van
I can't drive man, I can barely stand
Forget getting it up

I bet you faked it all along
And I bet you never missed me at all
I'm still waiting, I'm not moving on

If I came home right now
What would I find out?

You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You made my mom a scarf
Just like the one you made for me
It’s just like you to keep us warm
Even after I up and leave
I can’t remember when I last slept in my own bed
And I’m paying up for it in way more ways than rent
Catch me crying in the shower (how’s your day been?)
Crying in a traffic jam (how was your drive?)
Crying in the break room hoping no one else comes in
I bet your friends are thrilled
They don’t have to hear you go on
About another girl who’s great
But Boston’s still too damn far away
I know mine are over it
They’ve been rolling their eyes since
We nearly kissed in Ilana’s backyard
So I mailed you a book and a birthday card
Now I’m crying in the shower (how’s your day been?)
Crying in a traffic jam (how was your drive?)
Crying in the break room hoping no one else comes in
Crying into my fridge (are you eating?)
Crying at my own birthday (are you happier yet?)
Crying over every picture of your cat you send
Crying into my plate
At a Mexican place in Maine
Cause you won’t let me pay you back for a vacation I didn’t take
And it’s been two years to the day
Sick of Crying in the shower
Crying in a traffic jam
Crying in the bathroom when you asked me how’ve I’ve been
Crying into my fridge
Crying cause I’m leaving again
Crying when you told me I would still be your best friend And I can’t do this again
Been spending too much time
On dating websites
But the girls I meet
Well they mostly seem nice
Maybe I should just do something
Figure my life out
But things get complicated with someone else around
At twenty-five
Not quite where I would like
I could be alone forever
Or maybe fall in love or whatever
Feeling like it's now or never
Should probably fall in love or whatever
She’s twenty-two years old
Just graduated
Tells me that "Boston sucks
It's so overrated"
I try to steer the conversation somewhere else
But it's obvious it's not going to help
Twenty-six
Feels like there's some things I've missed
I could be alone forever
Or maybe fall in love or whatever
Feeling like it's now or never
I should fall in love or whatever
It might help me to forget her
If I could fall in love or whatever
Don’t want to be alone forever
I should fall in love or whatever
Guess I wasn't your type
But the way you looked me in the eyes
And told me that you had some free time
Next week some night
Well I kind of thought
I might at least get a response
Your silence only made me want to
Forget about you
And damn did it seem rude
You never texted to say
“Hey last night it was great”
Guess you don't feel the same way
All we had was an expiration date
But then I see
I've been the ghost here for a week
While looking back through conversations from our
Chat history
I realize it was me
That never texted to say
“Hey last night it was great”
I apologize for the wait
Hope you didn’t think we had an expiration date
The day ends
Then restarts
Each notification I get nearly stops my heart
But not one is from you
You were gone before you were
Something to lose
Now I don't know what to say
I think we might've been great
It's better never than late
Now we're long past our expiration date
Live in a house full of all my stuff
I’m grown up, grown up, grown up
But I can’t be sure of
When the last time was I loved someone
So what, so what, so what
It feels hard enough to come home and make myself sleep
Eat three square meals, wash my face, brush my teeth
And find a soulmate in which I don’t believe
If that means a lot well I don’t think it means it to me
Have no time to let in someone new
That’s not true, not true, not true
Should find a better excuse
For why I’m scared of what I can’t un-lose
I’ll make room, make room, make room
So I can tell you the thoughts that I’ve been holding in
We’ll both pretend you’re not sleeping with him
I understand now that the means always end
So let’s find out if we’re mutually friends
I’m sorry (sorry, sorry, sorry)
If you’re sorry (sorry, sorry, sorry)
I'm sorry (sorry, sorry, sorry)
If you’re sorry
I swiped myself to sleep last night
I want to set my iPhone on fire
'Cause Colin or Connor or David or Alex
Whatever his name is just asked me to breakfast
So I'll make excuses for my weekend
I cried myself to sleep last night
I want to throw myself in the Charles
'Cause Carolyn's thoughtful, she asked how my day went
And I can't bring myself to tell her it was fine
Her hair's tucked behind her ear ears like yours
If I met her I'd fall apart for sure

I don't have time for this
I don't have time for this
I don't have time

I dropped another shift tonight
I might have to quit my job
Someone cute works there and makes me feel anxious
What if they think I'm funny too
I'm not prepared for someone new
When it won't feel too soon

Have you had time for this
Have you had time for this
Now you don't have mine
Have you made room for this
Have you made room for this
My room's still a mess

I can't fall asleep most nights
I loved your voice when you're tired
The way we'd high-five every time we remembered
That all of our last firsts would happen together
The photo of us still pressed inside my wallet
The pile of your stuff growing tall inside my closet
If I ever knew what went wrong, I think that I forgot it
I told you things are better now, I wasn't being honest

Half of the time we wished
We had more time for this
We were half right
Tried for so long to live
In one room in two places
We kept our distance
So why do I look for you
In town and in people too
Sometimes I still miss
Someone to be lonely with
I believed memory might
Mirror no reflections on me
I believed that in forgetting
I might set myself free
But I woke up this morning
With a piece of past caught in my throat
And then I choked
I bled
Tried to hide the heart from the head
And I said I bled
In the arms of a girl I'd barely met
And I woke up this morning
With the present in splinters on the ground
And then I drowned
And if I can't see
It's for want of you
You said "I see"
If there's nothing here then its probably mine
My turn to see
If there's nothing here it will always be mine, mine
But I woke up this morning
With a piece of past caught in my throat
And then I choked
I guess I've learned
The taste of days that will always burn
I guess I've learned
If its in the corner of my eye I can't always turn
And I woke up this morning
With the present in splinters on the ground
And then I drowned
And if I can't see
It's for want of you
Caught in time so far away
From where our hearts really wanted to be
Reaching out to find a way
To get back to where we'd been
And if summer left you dry
With nothing left to try
This time...
Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
What could I do?
I have learned sometimes a need to run too deep
And we throw away the things
We most wanted to keep
And inside we lie over and over again
This time...
Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town
Around these hearts and hands
If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town
Around these hearts and hands

Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
What could I do?
I'm going down, going down
Deeper than inside
The world is my fuse
And once inside gonna tear
Till there's nothing left to find
And you wonder just how close
Close-up can be?
Can't you see? Can't you see?
I had a dream all my thoughts turned to real lips
And the world is my fuse
And just a dream, just a dream can bring me to my knees
And you wonder just how tight
Skin deep can be?
Can't you see? Can't you see?
I'm going down, going down
Deeper than inside
The world is my fuse
And from inside
Outside can just fall apart
And you wonder
Just how lost inside can be?
Try me, try me
Drink deep
It's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
I believe in moments
Transparent moments
Moments in grace
When you've got to stake your faith
Why do I confine
When all I want is release?
It moves outside you
It stays inside you
And it's not something that I could prove
Or could choose to be moved
Yes, it's a promise and it's a threat
And it's not something that I'll let you forget
Not just yet, not just yet
Why do I chase when all I want is near?
If it's not the rule then it's always the case
Good intentions get replaced
So close to reach but so hard to hold
The only chance you get is past your control
It's so hard, it's so hard
Drink deep
It's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
Time to surrender
Sweet surrender of all things in time
All things one place, one place
(Wide-eyed, innocent, boy! Wide-eyed innocent boy)
I’ve had days, of end on end
Where nothing changed cause nothing ever began
Restless movement in an empty room
Gathering shadows of a darkened blue
And oh
It feels so strange
Oh
It feels so strange
When it comes again
Cycles of end on end
Edges begin to blend
Time following time
A pattern becomes defined
(Go!)
I had a feeling from end to end
Tried to catch it before it started again
Pushed it away to force a laugh
But inside I didn't have the breath
And oh
It feels so strange
Oh
It feels so strange
When it comes again
But I’ve got it now
Yeah I’ve got the rhythm down
Cycles of end on end
And if one wave stops
Another begins
End
On end
Go!

Well I think I’ve got it now
Yeah I think I’ve got it down
Yeah I think I’ve got it down
Yeah this end on end
Cycles begin
Cycles begin
It’s end on end
It’s end on end
Cycles begin
Yeah!
It’s end on end, it’s end on end
Cycles begin
Watch them begin
But you can’t stop, you can’t stop, end on end
Can’t watch them end
Try to watch it end
It’s end on end, it’s end on end, it’s end on end
End on end
Watch them begin
It’s end on end, it’s end on end, it’s end on end
It seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Found!
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
It seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
(Woah! Go!)
(Get it! Go!)
(Woah! Woah!)
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Sssss...
Sssss...
Sssss...
(To write a piece about a solemn pagan rite, wise elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of spring.)
I found you passed out
In your room on the floor
There was mud on top your favorite shoes
A few more steps and you'd have made it
To your bed but sometimes
A few more steps is hard
It's hard to do
Before you make a mess of your face
Let's go a few drinks back
To when you swore you'd change
When I tried so hard to clench your shakin' frame
God, I know you would've killed her
If I let you

But I wouldn't let you do that
I can't watch you make it right
I tried to look away, but I
Don't know what makes me look back
Now I'm closin' that fence
I guess I finally got some sense
You can call me when you're finished
If you're ever finished with this


You disappeared to the bathroom and asked
If I'd hold your purse 'til you get back
These drugs will be the death of us
At least whatever's left of us
We'll find a new lie to believe
So you can finally get some sleep
You always knew how to keep me here
All I ever wanted was to leave
(Before you make a mess of your face)
To let go
(Let's go a few drinks back)
It's all I ever wanted
(To when you swore you'd change)
All I ever wanted was to leave
(And I tried to hard to clench your shakin' frame)
To let go
(God I know you would've killed her)
It's all I ever wanted
(If I let you)
All I ever wanted was to leave

They found you makin' love
In your room on the floor
That was me on top of you
A few more steps and we'd have made it
To your bed, but sometimes
A few more steps is hard to do
I am the voice inside your head
That crawled back up into your bed
Somehow I made off with your key and now
I come when I please and go when I want to go

You are the only thing I like
And you’ve been with me all the time
So while you’re somewhere out with your friends
I’m back here blowing up your cell phone

I’ve been practicing my lines
And you’ve been waiting up all night for me to call you
It makes me sick inside to be calling you up this late at night
But that’s what I do

You’ve been awaiting my return
And I’ve been equally concerned
Sleeping in the back of the van
So I can sober up and call you up again

I’ve been practicing my lines
And you’ve been waiting up all night for me to call you
It makes me sick inside to be calling you up this late at night
But that’s what I do

‘Cause there’s only one thing on my mind
When I hit you up this late at night


If falling in love is the best high
I’ve passed the best times of my life
Now the silence is cold
And every time we talk it’s dull and awkward
We used to only do this on the weekends
But now it’s almost every single night
I hear you down the hallway back there puking
I hear your pompous college friends; they’re puking outside
So, I pull your drawers and fill up your sink
Make everything exactly how you hate it all to be
Because I’m not trying to hold your hair
No, love won’t pass through me
Because I’m far too cynical for faith and make believe
'Cause there’s no such thing as love
We just felt vulnerable without a God
Without a crutch or anything else to lean on
So, I pull your drawers and fill up your sink
Make everything exactly how you hate it all to be
Because I’m not trying to hold your hair
No, love won’t pass through me
Because I’m far too cynical for faith and make believe
'Cause there’s no such thing as love
We just felt vulnerable without a God
Without a crutch
There’s nowhere else, nobody else, nothing
If I can get this hanger through the window of my car
I’ll never leave my house again for anything, I swear
Pacing in the driveway, I’m the nemesis of fun
With soggy hot dog buns from spilling warm beer in my trunk

Throwing down my jacket as I walk inside
I send a cloudy CD case flying off the side
Of a dresser from Ikea that I can’t get right
(God, I swear it’s missing pieces; I could choke someone)
“I guess you can come over if you’re really dry
But I’m not really trying to go out tonight"
It's been a really shitty day, I’d rather take some time
To just pound zinfandel by myself and unwind

“Remind me of the last time that we hung out, was it sick?”
'Cause I don’t remember anything, not a glimpse of it
And I would rather re-up than hear about your kids
But I hope that y’all are doing
Just as great as I expect you’re doing

‘P’ got me some gifts because she’s super tight
I’m lighterless, relying on the stove for a light
But I don’t really care, these are my favorite nights
(When I can sit on my ass and respond to no one)
“I guess you can come over if you’re really dry
But I’m not really trying to go out tonight"
No, with my clammy fingers grabbing every crumb that I find
I could sit around here for the rest of my life


If I can get this hanger through the window of my car
I’ll never leave my house again for anything, I swear
Pacing in the driveway, I’m the nemesis of fun
With soggy hot dog buns from spilling warm beer in my trunk
I caught you coming home from work
In your faded little-collared shirt
And now I’m itching to remove it
Ignore the whimpers of your roommate’s dog
I’m keeping with it until your shirt comes off
And we’ll be those crude humans

With all those bruises
And half of our clothes still on
To keep us uncomfortable
And we’ll sleep
When we’re tired of moving
Our arms and our legs entwined
Pretending that you are all mine
You caught me at a record low and got under my weak skin
I wonder if he really knows
The kind of shit you get to screaming
I wonder if he’s really clean
I wonder what he’d think of me if he knew what we’re doing

With all those bruises
And half of our clothes still on
To keep us uncomfortable
Could see us sleep
When we’re tired of moving
Our arms and our legs entwined
Pretending that you are all mine
Cause, I’m not yours
No, that’s not right
I’m just a novelty you’re toying with to complicate your life We’re not even friends
I’m just the means to an end
Still, I’d give all my self-respect up to be with you again
"Look, these teachers...these teachers want us to work, you know? And I say fine...I'll work. But you gotta let me do the kind of work that I wanna do. And for me, Lindsay, it's my- it's my drum kit, man. This my passion, you know? This is- this is the essence of who I am now. But before I had this, I was lost too. You see what I'm saying? You need to find...your reason for- for living, man. You've got to find, your big, just gigantic drum kit, you know?"
"Hey, maybe i'll buy a clarinet"

I'm no good with maps
I've no sense of direction
And I can't write anything without autocorrection
I just can't keep up with this curriculum
I wish I could learn in my sleep
I've got a problem with problems
I'm not punctual
I get lost in context and sentence construction
I've never said this to anyone before
I've never said it out loud
Safe to say
Mistakes were made
Now all my lungs
Are heart-shaped
But I can't find a better way to be
And I'm sick when you're not safe
But I can't find a better way to be
And you're sick when I'm safe
But I can't find a better way to be
Keep it coming
To keep you calling
Keep it coming
And I'll keep you safe
It's been a long time coming
I spent a long time rotting, before
It's been a long time coming
I spent a long time rotting, before
I got going, before
I got going
It's been a long time coming
I spent a long time rotting
I was crawling through the colors, before
I got going
And when the house had flooded
I surfaced above the covers
Then we slept in, rotting, before
I kicked my addiction to ammunition
Six years, I'm still the corpse king
Still writhing in this town
Head is on fire and you're the fuse
Barely bruising
And all the awful that I caught wind of
While trying to drown it
Well, it blew me away
To forget what you said
I'll need a good dose of magic
A helping of medicine and a breaking of habits
But it's not just what you said;
It's how the words danced all across your head
Maybe this is all none of my concern, but I can't sleep already
I can't wrap my head around your circumstances
But I can't sleep already

I'm so mad I can't fucking see straight
I'm so mad I can't fucking see straight
I'm so mad I can't fucking see straight
I'm so mad I can't even see straight
You're wrong
I don't want to talk this out
I don't give a fuck about your sister said about us
And we're both too drunk
To feel how awkward this really is
Thank God

I'm living somewhere with seasons
And drinking for better reasons than tolerating you

There's things I wish I would have said
I could have said
I could have said sorry if I wanted to
I could have said sorry if I wanted to
I could have said sorry if I wanted to
I could have said sorry if I wanted to

"That's, uh, fourteen mounted Toms, eight floor Toms, four splashes, two gongs, ten cowbells, four rides, fives snares, man... A roto-tom rack, and it's all mounted on my infamous quadruple kick drum system. Six more pieces, I've got a bigger kit than Neil Peart from Rush. Yeah!"
"That's great, Nick."
Whenever I fall asleep I keep on waking up to the same goddamn dreams
It's just me drowning with my arm, from the elbow up, reaching out for anything
Like in Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze
Is it my friends with their t-break moves, or just a little bit less fast food?
When you decide to leave this bullshit for bullshit and nothing
If you forget about me, it's alright, I understand I guess
I'd leave and forget if I had the chance
I still never got to the bottom of why you gave up
Ain't it kind of funny how the only thing that's never quite so mutual is me preaching perpetual while you're fulfilling ritual
I'm sorry to get technical but I find it acceptable
I'm moving on
There's something about my new stitched up thumb that makes it feel kind of funny calling it "moving on"
Now that you're gone
We need something to mask the weed smell here
Like a candle or fumes from the old space heater
Whenever I'm freaking out I keep the thought of the cast of Friends real close to my head
It's not absurd to say that 10 goddamn seasons would be the longest friendship I'd ever have
And if Ross and Rachel last, maybe this feeling too shall pass
But now you fuckers know I'm sad from all of these 20 minute intervaled claps
So when I decide to go illegally download my movies
I shouldn't have to take a breather
I really shouldn't get so mad if the video and audio don't quite match
I think I'm getting depressed again
I think I'm gonna lose all my friends
I'm trying to switch up my medicine
So I can be more of a gentleman
It's just the more I sleep, the less I eat
And everything would matter just a little bit less
If I saved a couple pounds and I just lost the rest
I guess I got too caught up in confidence to feel confident
I think I'm having a panic attack
I think I'm disappointing my dad
Just stuff me into a duffle bag
So I can feel all alone again
Whenever I fall asleep
I keep on having the same damn dreams
I know you heard this already
But I don't ever want you to leave
I thought you didn't even like to leave
And I know you can surf this too
Lauren
So glad you heard me callin'
So glad you know my name
And all my friends, well, the few left
It’s just me and you again

Stay at least 'til I'm asleep
’Cause I'm pretty fuckin' confident
That I'll die the next time
I'm alone in my bedroom
In my own fucking bedroom

Summer
Is right around the corner
You know what that means
Periodically your friends will all leave
They got their big dreams
I get it but it fuckin' sucks
It's the way things go
Come tomorrow
A blinding afterglow

Stay at least 'til I’m asleep
’Cause I'm pretty fuckin’ confident
That I'll die the next time
I'm alone in my bedroom
In my own fucking bedroom

I'm trying to move past this but no such luck
But you drag me the furthest from giving up
You asked for a smile, now there’s nothing but
Yeah, your roar's like a lion's while my mouth's taped shut
Ask me then I'll tell you why I'm always up so late
Why I still call shotgun no blitz when it's just the driver and me

I'm running out of friends
We'll sleep in different beds
'Cause you make me wanna stay awake
No one told me that mono lasted past all the cold and snow The doctor said "no smoking, kid"
I hope he just meant cigarettes
I always wanna go home when I'm already home
I wish that I could control-alt-delete my life
I leave an imprint of my lazy ass in the couch like every night
I just eat and sleep my days away and look through my video games
And if I don't find something good to play, I'm moving out
I just feel like my life is looking a hell of a lot like
The final scenes in Jurassic Park 3
It's easy, comes easy, comes easy for me
I always wanna go home when I'm already home
I wish I was as tough as you, dude
I would be so cool
I'd be just as dumb but without the gut
I'm getting laid
I bet I can throw down harder, dude
If I dropped out of school
There'll be blood and shit running down my fists
I'm getting laid
Let someone else try dabbing it first
These douche bags and tough guys are the fucking worst
I'm biting my tongue and it's starting to hurt
When this gets to me I'm diving in headfirst
I've got a problem with you and your friends
I fucking hate you since you met all of them
I've got some free time that I'd rather spend
Crossing off names in my hospital bed
There is a chest
Of skin, of drawers
With pictures of waterspouts
Coming out from the ocean and into the mainland
Where you once lived
Before
When you were younger
Before
You learned how to hope, want, or wish
Your step became unsteady once
Even more
Every time you would stand on shrapnel
Under your feet
There was a growth under your skin
An addition of pride
For your newfound wasteland
But even worse
The future you see
The future you bring
The future you are completely okay with
I could wait up sick
Waiting for a response
I could wait up, waiting for anything
And it’s something that you’re completely okay with
You've been standing outside of my apartment
With your mouth open wide, and I haven't heard enough of it
You've been standing outside of my apartment
With your mouth open wide, and I haven't heard enough of it
Tell me, tell me, Miranda
Where do you see yourself tomorrow?
Do you worry each Wednesday
When the week is almost over
Where you will sleep
Where you will sleep
Your sanctuary is Missouri in May
And I still insist on cutting my tongue off
You've been standing outside of my apartment
With your mouth open wide, and I haven't heard enough of it
You've been standing outside of my apartment
With your mouth open wide, and I haven't heard enough of it
I will not speak of the crash
Cause if it is never spoken of
Then history will never know it happened
If it is never written about
Then no one can ever read it
If it is never talked about
Then no one can ever hear it
Then no one can ever hear it
Then no one can ever hear it
Do we know the truths of every broken step?
Only if it's told
Forgotten when it's old
Undesired and cold
There is no story to be told
(We'll say)
We'll say
We'll meet up in some hotel room
Be it fancy or pay by the hour
And we'll comfort each other
Like we used to in our time
You'll say it'll be just like the old days
But it won't be the fucking old days
No it won't be the fucking old days
Only now with our broken parts
Our overused and torn up pieces
Will it be better than before?
Will it be better than before?
Do we thank our practice with others
Or will it be tarnished by exact thought?
Will it be better than before?
Will it be better than before?
Will it be better than before?
But I wish you never had to settle
For a cold phone, instead of a warm wake up tone
But I wish you never had to settle
For an annoying necessity, instead of a comforting chest cavity
I wanna be a part of your inside jokes
I wanna know about each pill you take and
Where deep in your in body it goes
What diseases do you think you have?
How bad it gets when you said
"Oh, it’s gonna get bad."
What tragedies you’ve faced
And to know when this place finally burns down
They won’t find our bodies in the waste
And I wish you never had to settle
For a bed too big, instead of stories of shit you got into way back
Back when you were a kid
Well I’m no longer looking for a filler
A random body to hold
I’m done stopping time
I’m finally ready to get old
And I know I’m nervous
And I’m feeling anxious
But I’m coming back to you
I’m done looking for some spaceship
And when I get there
It’ll be a storm;
I’ll be the tornado
That keeps you warm
I’ll be the tornado
That keeps you warm
(I'm looking at) pictures of myself smiling
With people I don't talk to or even talk shit on anymore
I want to talk about them with you
I want to tell you about my past
I want to tell you about trips I took when I was running away
Or fist fights I got into that got me out of class
I want to tell you about everything
I wish you could've been there
I wish you could've saved me that summer I swore
Pictures of planes crashing into bridges was the only way to express how I felt
Making broken seals in dissolvable stitches
Tracing new found veins into each tiny digit
And staring at screens
Living life around a battery
"oh i'm sorry, I can't go out
I'm stuck inside
Watching everything eventually go."
But I'm happy
Because if you let me
I will watch you die
I can’t take how easily the earth moves underneath my feet
But i’m too restless to sleep, no I haven’t even rest in weeks
I’ve been trying to find myself in others
Similarities that I could see
Is this all real life, or is this just all bad TV?
Why are we so afraid to watch the dead when they finally die?
Is it because we see their opportunities pass them by?
There’s a family in a cemetery
There’s a family in a home
If I can’t even afford a grave for myself
Than why am I so afraid of dying alone?
The home we were searching for
We’ll write our initials
In rock formations
On the mountains
Just like the cities we drove through
With so much
Much more freedom
Than here
Than these
East coast constraints
Could ever compare to
But do you remember
That Philly porch panic attack
And the late night talks
On the balcony?
Well I’ve been finding comfort
Spending the day time in bars
Watching how people in these cities act
Watching you play
Pinball arcade games
While I put my legs up and relax
I’m finally realizing
That home
Doesn’t have an address
But do you remember
Cherry cheeks on Chicago nights
And the late night talks
In other people’s living rooms
Pick out a postcard
(we’ll send it in the morning
But do you remember
Sleeping sitting up
And the late night talks
In every state we’ve been in
I’m finally realizing
That home doesn’t have an address
It doesn’t have an address
Have the decency to bury me
If you’re going to kick me dead
This is uplifting instrumental music for people who
Need a good talking to;
Find something new to hate
Find something else to fill your plate
Maybe you’d like me again if I went back to the bottle
Maybe you’d like me again if I went back to being miserable
We could be unhappy together
We could be drunk together
We could be punk together
We could be friends again
Just when you think you’ve dusted off your ghosts
New ones form to take their place
Well I’m old enough to know
I’ve never been much of a fan of the aftertaste
You are a bunch of
Metaphors and similes (in someways)
Tucked away in
Passive aggressive failed poetry
But you don’t deserve a second of bad mouthing
You don’t deserve even a crow call to your name
I’ll leave your tongue for the coasts
I’ll leave your words for the toasts
Enemies come and enemies go
Some burn dull enough just to fade away
I can’t wait to see you fade away
Just when you think you’ve dusted off the ghosts
New ones form to take their place
Well I’m old enough to know
I’ve never been much a fan of the aftertaste
I wanna see you hate who you were
I wanna see you hate yourself for what you’ve done
Your mother was right
You are the bastard type
And I won’t fuel the fire that keeps you warm
You’ve given me more
Than a chip on my shoulder
I’ve got enough anger to fight this whole war
If you want to be missed
You can’t live like this
Get out while you can, I’ll call when I care
Just when you think you’ve dusted off the ghosts
New ones form to take their place
Well I’m old enough to know
I’ve never been much a fan of the aftertaste
There are people that will make you bitter
Angry, entirely for the rest of your life
And there are people that will willingly
Warm your cold bones so you can finally sleep a night
I need something new to obsess over
I need something new to obsess over
"Why You Always Leave A Note"
You get away from your troubles
You get away now you're getting older
I have traveled your brain
You bury, you bury
You've buried our love
The tough sands we walk in
The weight of the water
As we agree we both know where we stand
But I know we can't agree on the fine line that we're walking
You bury, you bury
You've buried our love
I have traveled your brain
You get away from your troubles
You get away now you're getting older
You will
It's no wonder where our love's gone
It's no wonder; from us to dust
When you come down
Tell me how your love, tell me how you have
Gone from me to him and back to me
Tell me how you can bury your head between
The space that fills your fears and feeds your dreams
Tell me your reasons, tell me your dreams
When we're the best that we could be ever be
Tell me how you can bury your head between
The Space that fills your fears and feeds your dreams
It's the floor I'm reaching for
A breath beneath the surface
It weighs me down, it cuts me from
The line that you've been reeling
The sails are slashed, we're fucked for sure
I'm waiting on the breakers
It's the floor I'm reaching for
A breath beneath the surface
If there's a light from that beacon
I can count the distance
In this thick, hazy, pea-soup fog
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
I can count the distance
From where we should be
From where I thought we'd be by now
I can see it in the clouds
We break faster than pressure in a fold
We break faster than pressure in a fold
It's the floor I'm reaching for
A breath beneath the surface
The sails are slashed, we're fucked for sure
I'm falling starboard, I'm falling over
I'm falling starboard, I'm falling over
I'm aimless amongst connoisseurs
I'm a stranger to these troubles
Why can't I pick you up?
You’re sheer like the cliffs that you jump off from
I watch you closer than a...
You picked me up again
From the bottom of my bay
My sun soaked skin
It's a subtle feeling
To find yourself in
The place we’ve all been missing
My sun soaked skin
It's a subtle feeling
To find yourself in
The place we've all been missing
I missed you more when we were alone
I miss the breakers breaking everything I've known
I missed you more when we were alone
I miss the breakers breaking skin right off my bones
You've held on
I've been around
You've been remiss
End your own gains in lieu of this
You've held on
It's in the past I can't remember
Because it reminds me
We're an act
We're a farce
It's better that we don't
If the Gods are fair then I am fucked
I am my father’s son
My sun soaked skin
It's a subtle feeling
To find yourself in
The place we’ve all been missing
My sun soaked skin
It's a subtle feeling
To find yourself in
The place we’ve all been missing
I've been distracted and distant
And I'm all out of ideas
The bees keep swarming around me
The sun starts running on empty
Grace once watched over me as well
But not anymore
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
I couldn't just leave it all
I couldn't stop craving the tension
But we keep winning the races
(We're framed, we're fine, we're good enough)
But we keep winning the races
(We're framed, we're fine, we're good enough)
We set our sails with the north wind
In love or vein it'll need a winch
To carry us above
'cause you need to know
You need to know
You need to know the winds
You need to know
You need to know the winds
I'm all out of everything
Lacking in oxygen
I'm all out of everything
Lacking in oxygen it seems
So you came to me in cloak
And you spoke to me in slang
You sing as loud as the sirens
You sing as loud as the sirens
I bottomed out beneath the bridge on Metropolitan and Driggs
Been at it for a while
This place is like an animal
I'm leaving for the water
It's time that I go back
To a place I should've been born
It's not so far away

But I shake
Like a painting on the sea
A leaf in the trees

Have I made myself clear?
You're in the corner of my brain
I've seen the line go slack
If I've always been this way
Then I own up to it
And I'm still sorry that I

I shake
Like a painting on the sea
A leaf in the trees

There's something to be said
There's something to be said
So if I can just sit here
There's something to be said
There's something to be said
So if I can just here

I'll find the words to break-in
I'll break beneath the surface
Some bad blood that settled
Like dawn on the sea
You mean everything to me

Like dawn on the sea
You mean everything to me
Like dawn on the sea
You mean everything to me
I'm heartsick
And well rehearsed
Highly decorated
With a badge that reads
"It could be worse"
So prideful I choose
To live in disguise
With a levee set
For my heavy eyes

I apologize for the grief
When you'd refuse to eat
I didn't know
Just what to say
While watching you
Wither away

I'm homesick
And living in the past
Seemingly unfazed and strong if anyone asks
I'm keeping up appereances with white lies
With a levee set
For my heavy eyes

I apologize for the grief
When you'd talk about belief
I didn't know
Just what to say
While watching you
Wither away

It was time this whole time
It was time this whole time
It was time this whole time
We can't undo or rewind
Just a simple conversation
About nothing much at all
Couldn't keep me in the room
I just kept walking
Down the hall
But now I understand
Just what a fool I'd been
No matter what the context
I won't have that time again
(And I'll live with that)

I took inventory
Of what I took for granted
And I ended up with more than I imagined
I've kept it bottled up and to myself in the cellar
Kept for my ever-changing mental health

It was time this whole time
I took inventory of what I took for granted
And I ended up with more than I imagined
It was time this whole time
I've kept it bottled up and to myself in the cellar
Kept for my ever-changing mental health
Somehow it's already been a year
Embracing all diversions to make this feeling disappear
Now I just feel you everywhere
It coincides with the guilt of knowing that I wasn't there
I was told that you wouldn't have known
Told myself I was where you'd want me to be
(But it's not that easy)
I tried to be your light
Did my best to shine
Nothing I do feels right
As I went out all the time
How has it already been a year?
I skip over songs, because they're too hard to hear
Like track two on Benji or "What Sarah Said"
They just hit too close when I'm already in my head
I was told you were half asleep
Told myself you would be proud of me
(But it's not that easy)
I tried to be your light
Did my best to shine
Nothing I do feels right
As I went out all the time
Somehow it's already been a year
You keep finding new ways to make yourself reappear
I hope you never leave me be
I haven't found that courage to listen to your last message to me
With so much gloom surrounding
I feel cornered up against the wall
Pulled down and slowly drowning
Taking bets on who is next to fall
I saw the glass as half full
So I felt I could ask for more
I was comfortable
It spilled over onto the floor
I beg to come back to before
With the damage done
And the damage won
Like a wave
Like the rapture
Something you love is gone
Something you love is gone
Like a wave
Like the rapture
Something you love is gone
Something you love is gone
Someone you love is gone
Someone you love is gone
And leaves you fractured
I saw the glass as half full
So I felt I could ask for more
I was comfortable
It spilled over onto the floor
I beg to come back to before
With the damage done
And the damage won
I saved the worst for last
I saved the worst for last
You died at 69
With a body full of cancer
I asked your god
"How could you"
But I never heard an answer
No one saw it coming
The diagnosis of stage four
The bravest woman I know
That survived it once before
Last week I crashed my car
And I walked away unscathed
Maybe that was you
Asking me to keep my faith
You'd cry at the thought of never seeing me again
If there was an afterlife
Or what you'd call heaven
I've never felt so selfish, it's not what I prefer
I always kept it honest, especially for her
She gave me her best
She swore I was her heart
I couldn't worship the god that let her fall apart
I'm not sure what I believe
Well I think that's understood
But I know she's looking out for me
The way she said she would
The way she said she would
The way she said she would
What was it that brought you west?
I assumed but can only guess
It's the questions that went unasked
That appear when time has passed
It felt like many years
Taking apart our home
I dug through forty years
All alone

On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

Was it all the palm trees
Placed where they shouldn't be
That made you feel complete
In this land of make believe

Like going 65 on the 5 at 5
Like going 65 on the 5 at 5

On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

I am still bereaved
Come every ocean breeze
Was it all the palm trees
Placed where they shouldn't be
That made you feel complete
In this land of make believe

What was it that brought you west?
What was it that brought you west?
What was it that brought you west?
Where I lay my head to rest
It felt like many years
Taking apart our home
I dug through forty years
All alone
This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends’ bodies
When the floodwater comes, it ain’t gonna be clear, it’s gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim, I will help you swim, I’m gonna help you swim
This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I’ve made, for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more
It’s no big surprise you turned out this way
When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair, and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said “Hey man, I love you, but no fucking way”
I’m sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies
This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in
Naked and dumb on a drunken night
And it should've felt good, but I could hear the Jaws theme song
On repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned
Consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, the look on your face, I will not be brave
I’m sure we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies
I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don’t wanna watch and then complain
‘Cause I am through finding blame
That is a decision that I have made
She hopes I’m cursed forever
To sleep on a twin size mattress
In somebody’s attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night, every night
Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room
So when I'll wake up, I'll be like, "Yeah, everything's alright"
You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing
You are still the only thing and everything I need in my life
And it goes in, in, out through the mouth
Breathing exercises I will never figure out
So I am running in circles or (I am) walking in circles or
(I am) Crawling in circles or lying on the ground

And I...
Can hear your dog whistle
From my bedroom
Yeah, yeah
And I...
Can see a flashlight cuttin'
Up the trees behind my house
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She says a lot of the kids we graduated with are now homeless
Which puts them in mad shady situations with mad shady people
If not every day, then on an every-other-day basis
And she's probably with a few of them right now
And they are probably just drinking and talking about
How she misses getting fucked up and hangin' around
And he says "Hey, you're good at that"
And she says "Thanks, it's kind of all I got"
And then she looks away and says, "It's also all I need"
And I can smell plastic burning
I can smell chemicals breaking down
I got your last three emails, the ones where you said
"I was sorting some things out"

And he will be able to hear her dog whistle
From his bedroom
Yeah, yeah
And I
Can see a flashlight cuttin'
Up the trees behind my house
Yeah, yeah

And I will read the flashing
Like a Morse Code explanation
That will mean nothing
But take all night to figure out, out, out

When I am sad, I am sad
But when I am happy, oh God, I'm happy
(Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room)
There's just no place in between for us to meet
(So when I'll wake up I'll be like
Yeah everything's alright)
When I am sad, I am sad
But when I am happy, oh God, I'm happy
(You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing)
There's just no place in between for us to meet
(You are still the only thing
And everything I need in my life)
When I am sad, oh God, I'm sad
But when I'm happy, I am happy
(Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room)
And there's just no place in between for us to meet
(So when I'll wake up I'll be like
"Yeah, everything's alright")
When I am sad, oh God, I'm sad
But when I'm happy, I am happy
(You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing)
And there's just no place in between for us to meet
I fucking hate the comments
Why do you feel you have to talk?
Nobody asked for your opinion
Your sick, sad way of jerking off
Everyone you think you're better than
What the fuck! I'm guilty too
Half the time that I'm complaining
I'm just talking shit on you, I'm sorry

Never underestimate
The poor, hungry, and desperate
My body is a temple
How much do you think I can get for it?
And I will take cold showers
From now on until I learn
That once you fuck with fire
All that's left to do is burn, baby, burn; baby, burn

I could feel myself falling from an aeroplane
I hear static when I close my eyes
I imagine one day, things settling
And I think about what that might be like

'Cause I love you, I miss you
(When my mind is uncertain, my body decides)
I wanna hug and kiss you
(What it will do to get through the hell of life)
Oh, I love you, I miss you
(As I trip on the ocean that leads through your eyes)
I wanna hug and kiss you, it´s alright

I want world domination
Just like everybody else
So if you hear me talking strategy
Aw, it's only to myself
Everybody's got to have a game plan
Cut it up a couple different ways
Just hope no one remembers these
The darkest of my days

When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
You are my peach, you are my plum
You are my earth, you are my sun
I love your fingers, I love your toes
The back of your head, the tip of your nose
And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
One day, you will find someone
Who will love you like you deserve
But tonight, I'm the only one left
And I'm betting it's a fact that you will never learn
Once I sink my teeth, your skin's not so tough
I'll leave a tiny cut, there'll be a lot of blood
But once you wipe it up
You will feel better about our entire situation
You are my light, no need to hide
You are my clock, keep me on time
You are my angel, you are my crime
I'll serve this sentence the rest of my life
And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
I do things wrong
You thought I might
You say I'm gonna miss you when you leave
And you are probably right
But I'm just as stoned
I don't wanna fight
You say I should think before I talk
You say I shouldn't think about my life
'Cause once I finally hit the ground
Who's gonna drag me into the light?
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, whoa
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, whoa
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
"Is it raining where you are?"
The only thing I could think to ask
But nothing ever hurt so bad
As the "no" that you said back
But ain't that the truth, man?
Those are just facts
The farther you go from where you start
The harder it is to get back

Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good
This is for all my friends in West Virginia
The good stuff comes, the good stuff goes
The good stuff seems so hard to hold
Hope it slides slowly down your throat
So the taste of it may linger
Right now I'm just a volcano (like I said!)
On the brink of eruption (like I said!)
Right now I'm just a psycho
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction

Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good
I wish I may I wish I might
One day live life
Like a person in paradise
Right now I'm just a volcano (like I said!)
On the brink of eruption
Right now I'm just a psycho
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Ride or die
Brothers for life
Darkest days
Coldest nights
Ride or die
Brothers for life
Darkest days
Coldest nights
There ain't no doctor on Earth
There ain't no lord up above
Who knows a strong enough medicine
Or a life-saving love
Like I said I thought I was focused
I thought I had it all figured out
I had to organize my words good
Before they'd fall right out my mouth
And I had learned that the direction
I was walking was so wrong
I just need a little help here, man
To find the path I should be on

Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good
Love of my life
Gone forever
Get her back good
Good lord you know
I wish I could
You won't leave the table
She won't leave your mind
Gotta get out of Ohio
Feeling short on time
Eyeball your inheritance
Dead stare at the bar
Put back one more
Stumble under the stars

We could fly to Ireland
You know I'm good for the ticket
Try to smirk, but you're smiling
Know I'll stick with it
Annie, I want you to marry me
We'll wait a few years
I don't mean to frighten you
I just wanna be clear


She's a drink behind you
Wander off to the stairs
Ten bucks for the last game
Suck smoke from the air
Man, it cuts like a dull knife
When you're young and you're told
"Makes sense when you're older"
Darling, let's get old


I'd say you look tired
Sing, my secret choir
Soak my scrapes and sleep tight
Sing, my brave acolyte
I'd say you look tired
Sing, my secret choir
Soak my scrapes and sleep tight
Sing, my brave acolyte
I will lose you if I can't be alone
I'm in love with your eyes when you get me stoned
Drive me home and I'll sleepwalk back to you
I am the girl that I thought I outgrew

22 years old in my parents home
Still speaking in whispers on the phone
Grandma lit up cursing in the guest room
All pissed off over the font on the family tomb
When I leave I will leave in a quiet way
I'm too quiet to do anything but stay
I keep trying to outline a better life
But the pen's run dry, yeah the pen's run dry
The lines never come out right anyway

Oooooh, oh, oooooh oh
Oooooh, oh, oooooh oh

There are monsters everywhere I turn
In disguises my young self couldn't discern
See them now in my brother's passing
See them now in my father's absence
One is curled in a bedside wineglass
In the master bedroom, on mother's half
I can hear the floorboards on which they creep
I can feel their fingers while I sleep
In a dream I am 14 all again
Watching my big brother talk to them
Saying "She ain't half your height, pick on someone else tonight."

Oooooh, oh, oooooh oh
Oooooh, oh, oooooh oh
I saw her in a dream
Exiting the bookstore lobby
Sitting on a bench on Baltimore and reading Murakami
Slipping salt beneath the sun
Her hands now tying up her hair
One pair of deeply tinted shades reflects my unbelieving stare
And at once
I am taken
She asked me what I wanted
As if one ever really knew
And I said, "Dull domestication, free from pressure to pursue
Another love, another touch, another tired conversation"
And then she shut her novel sharply
And proposed a new location
And at once
I obliged
Details for a new protest
Adorn white printer paper flyers
She says, "I feel so old admitting counter-culture makes me tired"
She leads me into the café
Her intention is exact
It is 104 degrees
She takes her coffee hot and black
And at once
I am entranced
She suggests we settle down
Meaning, settle down for good
She knows the perfect place on Martha Street
In her old neighborhood
And then a taxi sounds a horn
And it is full of all our things
And it is parked outside the café
And the driver sounds incredibly
Impatient
When we merge onto the freeway
She rolls her window down completely
The driver dials into a station
And then she smiles at me discreetly
She says, "I love this song"
Then turns away and tracks the clouds
The driver curses with conviction
While "Heavy Metal Drummer" plays us out
She smoked 100s when I met her
She tried to quit before she left me
I'm not so sure if that's important
Free association gets me dizzy
They ask, "What's the reason for your appointment?"
I try to come up with something vague
She asks if I'm going to the party
I tell her I'm going to the party
It's so hot by noon I just get queasy
It's so hot by two I stay inside
I try to put down a cup of coffee
He asks how much I'm drinking and I lie
But doctors are always trying to tell you
Some torturous way to live your life
It's not like they know everything ever
Hey man, I went to college too
But all of the kids I met on campus
Are settled down beside the sea
Some days I wish that I could be that
Sometimes I forget to spit out the seeds
I'll make it through this if it kills me
And when it kills me I'll come back
Jesus will make me a disciple
Or maybe he'll let me be your cat
I wait to be led into temptation
As I lay a load across the street
Catherine is smoking pot above me
Watching "Hellraiser" on TV
Tomorrow I'm driving to Chicago
Tonight I am kneeling from the pew
Still doing all I can to understand
One more erotic nightmare about you
Put my best shoes on and meet mother in the kitchen
Following sister stomping plastic
Empty milk gallon graveyard, recycling rockstars
Soldiers of the lord

Stare out my window at the neighbours at night
Serpentine explanations for why I stayed out of sight
Rosemary Robinson, my stars and my sun
Hannah and I in the cemetery aisles overcome with belief
That everything we'd eat

Was good and clean
We'd spit our seeds
Gonna make this garden grow
Inch by inch and row by row
Row by row

Early winter morning, Beau puts on the coffee
Making records in my bedroom
Tin foil in the heat vents
Get high in the basement
Sing into my mouth

Perched on the counter in our shorts and our socks
Share a smoke on the sofa and blow a kiss to the cops
Here, help me move the kitchen table aside
Heaven Hill in the freezer for the bags stamped beneath our eyes Opened miles wide

And all we'd seen
Was gold and green
Gonna make this garden grow
Inch by inch and row by row
Row by row
Walking outside labyrinthian
Over cracks along under the trees
I know this town grounded in a compass
Cardinal landing in the dogwood
I keep going over it over and over
My steps iterate my shame
How come every outcome's such a comedown?
Lately afternoon with the shades drawn down
I kept saying I just wanted to see you
Saying, "What's wrong with that?"
Needles shaking outlines in a compass
Every outcome's such a comedown

I knew it when I saw it
So I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it
I saw your boyfriend at the port authority
That's a sort of fucked up place
Well so I averted my stride on a quick one
He's coming back from going over to your place, huh?
I feel like I could forget about it
I feel like I could mellow out
I don't feel undone in a big way
There's nothing really bad to be upset about
But when I thought I was getting better
I woke up on the ground
An appointment or disappointment
A setback, oh, another comedown

As if I needed a reminder
Oh, I do only what I want to
So I go through with this
Walking out in the nighttime springtime
Needling my way home
I saw Leah on the bus a few months ago
I saw some old friends at her funeral
My steps keep splitting my grief
Through these solipsistic moods
I should call my parents when I think of them
Should tell my friends when I love them
Maybe I should have gone out a bit more
When you guys were still in town
I got too caught up in my own shit
It's how every outcome's such a comedown

And I knew it when I saw it
Oh, I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it
So satisfied I said a lot of things tonight
So long, aphasia, and the ways it kept me hiding
It's not so much exactly all the words I used
It's more that I was somehow down let them loose
So complicated
I can't wait to get explaining
Your listening distended out since I've been crying
So long, aphasia, and the ways it kept me hidden
So long to silent nerves and hesitant oblivion
You came and sent me out unfurling in the street
I felt unprecedented confidence in speaking
Stick around I'm thinking things'll be alright
Newly delivered, won't you live with me tonight?
Something tonight was such a let down on my pride
It takes a part of me I don't got to take some things in stride
I'd pace around the place so quiet in myself
I'd wake the next and see my silence went unfelt
Just when I thought I had this pattern sorted out
Apparently my ventricles are full of doubt, now
Nah things go wrong sometimes
Don't let it freak you out
But if I don’t have you by me then I’ll go underground
Nah but what you've got was in your reaches all along
Plus one day you’ll be reaching for me and I’ll be gone
So to help remind myself
I wrote this little song
One day I won’t need your love
One day I won't define myself by the one I’m thinking of
And if one day I won't need it
And one day you won't need it
Was walking with my neck out
In some ways I wish I was
Was walking with my neck out
In some ways that I wish that I was
Out on the bevel sound
It sounds like everything else
You'll know it when you hear it
Cause you know the way that my voice falls
Ignore my tone and everything
I sing, I sing for me
Ignore the phone on the bed
It rings, it rings, it rings
Shirt collar wringing me out
My collarbone got all red
Already severing prose
I wrote, I sing instead
I hold you put your neck out
Tell me the ways you wish you were
Keep your confidence sound
Your hook my eye my spur
So when I went to hang out
I hung behind your eyes
My eyes still flicker with doubt
Quickly oh I can't decide
I'm tapped out
Don't it always seem to go that
You could hold it right in your hands
Collapsing and still not know
In your hands
Collapse and still not know
Say what it is
Say how it is with everybody I know
I got no temper for that
I send you this cadmium red
One for every layer I shed
And I shed one layer for this
Say what it is
It's so impossible
But if I just say what it is
It tends to sublimate away
When I was looking to drop
My life away
More every year
I shine light on edges I tried to unfeel
We both gotta do better than that
Some sorting out
I'll be sitting on the outskirts if you wanna talk about it
Things in there are getting so loud
Say what it is
It's so impossible
But if I just say what it is
It tends to sublimate away
When I was looking to drop
My life away
Is there anyone here I know
I look around the room
Whatever I let it go
Steve's in Germany, that's it
I try to think of anyone else
No, yeah, that's it
I resolve to make new friends
I liked my old ones
But I fucked up so I'll start again
What's the worst that could happen
Strings frayed like my good days
Tied around my finger
I felt so afraid
I had my mind on her on my own
But when I looked back up
Everybody else was gone
So I resolve to make new friends
Someone tell me to quit my head
And help me forget it
What's the worst that could happen
The end of summer and I'm still in love with her
I said
Forget it
Was it worse that I wasn't sure
The end of summer and I'm still in love with her
I said
Forget it
Forget it
Forget it
Do you wanna dance?
Fine, but do you remember when
In your living room
When we made some room and moved ourselves around in it?
It's how my heart resumed
I got caught, you got those Caravaggio moves
We had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room
Do you wanna talk?
Fine, I'll talk it out with my dad
It's always nice what he says
He'll have some good advice from something in a book he read
If I did what I wanted then why do I feel so bad?
Would you like a drink
While we wait for everything
To get good again?
We're good at things and so are a lot of our friends
We should forget these setbacks and get back moving again

I dont know what I'm afraid of
But I'm afraid
One day it all will fall away
Maybe I read that
But still, let's see
If nothing else it's an idle curiosity
So would you like that drink?
Fine, yeah, I know, I remember that too
In your living room, right?
When we began to fight but then we both felt confused
Then we were laughing and crying in awe of the size of the moon
Do you want to die?
Fine, you're right
But I wonder what it feels like
To stop feeling so alive
What if we could wake up in five years and things'd be feeling alright?
I wanna visit the future and dance in a field of light

I dont know what I'm afraid of
But I'm afraid
One day it all will fall away
Maybe I read that
But still, let's see
If nothing else it's an idle curiosity
I want to burden you
I want to burn in you
I want to burden you
I want to burn in you

With some more fleeting than spring
Somehow my days keep dragging
I want your summer, salty skin
Without yours, mine is wearing thin
I carved your name into a tree
It scarred the same as it did me
Follow me home, between my sheetsAnd mend the burden in me

And I want you
But I don't want to

I'll never say "I loved you"
Because you know I still do
I'll always think of your lips
When I'm moving mine against his
I wanna know, I wanna know
If I'm burning in your mind also
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I'm your burden, you're mine to swallow

I want to burden you
I want to burn in you
I want to burden you
I want to burn in you

And I want you
But I don't want to

I'll never say "I loved you"
Because you know I still do
I'll always think of your lips
When I'm moving mine against his
I wanna know, I wanna know
If I'm burning in your mind also
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I'm your burden, you're mine to swallow
I get lost with you
I dogwalk with you around the block
I get by with you
I get high with you best I can
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
I wanna cry with you
I wanna die with you once or twice
I wanna lie with you
Until the pain is through for a while
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
You must've took me for a walk (cause I'm short of breath)
You must've stomped right up (and scared away my death)
You must've took me for a walk (cause I'm short of breath)
You must've stomped right up (and scared away my death)
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
I'd do anything to make you feel
To make you feel
You must've took me for a walk (cause I'm short of breath)
You must've stomped right up (and scared away my death)
You must've took me for a walk (cause I'm short of breath)
You must've stomped right up (and scared away my death)
Have I been good?
Have I been strong?
Pin a star
Won't take long
Time can be so cruel
Steal my youth
Soothe my wounds
Don't waste your time
Cause it won't wait for you
Take time with me cause I don't wanna be alone
All alone
(Have I been good?)
Take time with me
(Have I been strong?)
Cause I don't wanna be alone
(Pin a star)
All alone
(Won't take long)
(Have I been good?)
Take time with me
(Have I been strong?)
Cause I don't wanna be alone
(Pin a star)
All alone
(Won't take long)
How did I get so depressed?
I wasn't born like this
But when you're around
I'm bored and faking it
Yeah, when you're around
I'm stoned and full of shit
Your sweet nothing
Ain't nothing but steam
Like my suffering
Ain't nothing but a scheme
Your sweet nothing
Ain't nothing but steam
Like my suffering
Ain't nothing but a scheme
How did I get so depressed?
I wasn't born like this
But when you're around
I'm bored and faking it
Yeah, when you're around
I'm stoned and full of shit
Don't love me for my misery
You love me, oh, you love me
Don't love me for my misery
You love me, oh, you love me
Is it so pitiful to be a kid like me
If our shit falls apart it’s all water in our hearts
I won’t be pitiful if you could see me bleed
But you don’t say a thing, don’t say you love me
The wind is faithful when I’m going home alone
Let me sink like a stone in the back of your throat
But you’re so beautiful and I just can’t believe
What I do to myself, I’d just like you to see, yeah
8am is stifling
Re-acclimate to human
Alien ways left flittering behind
Eyes rolled to the sky
Sex pulled to the sky
Fears told to the sky
Had a dream you dissect me
Strip me down, make sure I'm clean
But I feel unclean
Rubber gloves round my skull base
Peel the skin back, reshape my face
You say I look better this way
You're in my head and you won't go
You're in my head and you won't go
Outer space for you, moon's got a face for you
A white hot blank for you, so go
Electric tape for you, bound arms and legs for you
I'd waste away for you, so go
You love me, you love me not
I can't bear another boring night
You disgust me, you disrupt my every thought
I bleach my head of you
My little worm, divide in two
You want me, you want me
You want me, now stop
You want me, you want me
You want me, now stop
You love me, you love me not
I can't bear another boring night
You disgust me, you disrupt my every thought
I want you gone
Up and down like a red rubber ball
You're always back and forth like the clock on the wall
I want to know about you
I'm spinning all around you
If I stay, do you think that we could change your routine?
I know a trick, I've always got a few up my sleeve
This life is controlled confusion
It's just a grand illusion

And you ask me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you ask me
"How do you pass the days?"

Sing along to a song that I know
It goes bah-bah-bada, sing it over and over
Let it hypnotize you
I'm still here right beside you
Hold my hand, you can follow my lead
You're like a ballerina twirling 'round on your feet
And watching is so fantastic
I want to ask you

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Now collapse, take delight in the fall and catch your breath
I know you feel the ring from it all
So try and collect yourself now
It's just a euphoric comedown

And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"
'Cause I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark
And I told you to come
And you followed where I asked you to go
You'd go

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
I found a picture that we took when we brought in the new year
It's hard to see but I remember
You wore a cocktail dress
Ignored the goosebumps on your neck
The name sake of your outfit to keep you warm

You always said that every thought I had was geometric
I couldn't think outside my own lines
I hope you're alright, and I'm sorry that I wasted your time
Never had the intention to make you go
Oo, oh oh, oh


To make you go
To make you go, to make you go
I never wanted to make you go
You might be a stranger now
And I just wanted to let you know
That I meant what I said
And every dream I've ever had has been of myself
And every dream I've ever had's been of a
Better view with a ten month summer
Losing you is like cutting my fingers off

And even with that summer
Without you I'd rather cut my fingers off
I hear you’ve been telling all your friends
That you’re done with me
Like you always knew things wouldn’t work out
And I’ve been hearing things from people
That I don’t want to talk to
Like it matters who you’re sleeping with now
Can I erase from my mind anything that you said or
Any time that we spent with each other?
I don’t want to waste away another cell on a memory
When you’re just another meaningless lover

Forget the nights that we spent laughing
Till the morning on your bedroom floor
Without a thought about your roommate
Asleep down the hall
Forget the days we’d waste in bed, tangled
The smoke still on your breath
Undressed and pinning you up to the wall
And I swore I heard you talking when I was tossing in my sleep
You were always trying to walk in circles around me
I was out one night when I saw you
And you froze me where I stood
I would hate you, I would hate you if I could

Forget the nights that we spent laughing
Till the morning on your bedroom floor
Without a thought about your roommate
Asleep down the hall
Forget the days we’d waste in bed, tangled
The smoke still on your breath
Undressed and pinning you up to the wall
I would hate you
But  I’m not finished yet
I would hate you
But I’m not finished yet
Even you, up on that pedestal
The time will come
When you will deconstruct yourself
And remake what you are
When it does you’ll remember me
And the words I spoke
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far
Even you, up on that pedestal
The time will come
When you will deconstruct yourself
And remake what you are
When it does you’ll remember me
And the words I spoke
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far
Can I stay at home? I don’t want to go
I don’t want to wake up till the sun is hanging low
Stay up through the night, sleep away the light
Just another dream I had that's better than my life

Adolescent dreams gave to adult screams
Paranoid that I won’t have all the things they say I need
What if I don’t want a pattern on my lawn?
All I know is something's wrong because everyday I'm

Craving that new scream
Lusting for more than just old dreams
I’ve been dying to feel alive
And I’ve been wasting all my time
Chasing the high

Can I reset my brain? If not, I’ll go insane
I swear to God that I don’t think I can go another day
Am I the only one? Is this in all of us?
I hate the thought that I’m alone, but I hope that you're not

Craving that new scream
Lusting for more than just old dreams
I’ve been dying to feel alive
And I’ve been wasting all my time
Chasing the high

Still craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust and I’ve been waiting still, craving
Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young
Positively unattached
Naïve and unattracted to the buzz
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song
Show me why you're always smiling
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space
Drawn outside the lines
Your world's a vibrant illustration you create

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole
Deep down into an old slope
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go
Spinning out of control

Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive
Just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive
Cruel one convinced you in his stillness
In a dream, safe and harmless

Unknown to you
Wolf in sheep’s clothing
Hand over mouth
His secrets you’re holding
I can see you and the ache you’re hiding
I’m here you know I’ll always remind you

Lonely one, I always knew
The future tells a hazel view
Gemstone, like polish and acetone
For you are my sister sewn
I know you like the drive home
Breath deep, the knower’s perspective
You’ll see how the rest of this is undeniable

Hold out for June, it brings new season
Vision is clear, your mind revealing
Pressing the flower in the page
Forever kept, a memory made
Now you’re so sure, you’re always leading
All the same words now bring new meaning
I can hear you and I know you’re singing
“I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.”

Lovely one
Four leaf luck
Skilled hands built you up

Hold out for June, it brings new season
Vision is clear, your mind revealing
Pressing the flower in the page
Forever kept, a memory made
Now you’re so sure, you’re always leading
All the same words now bring new meaning
I can hear you and I know you’re singing
“I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.”
“I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.”
Lie to me, like you used to
Tell me everything is how it should be
Lie to me, did you have to?
'Cause in the end, it never matters what I think

And I can barely tell the sky from the shoreline
And I can see myself reflected in your eyes

And this was all a dream
And it's coming back to me
A portrait in grey scale
A perfect betrayal
And I can't even breathe
With this weighing on my chest
You knew me at my best
Now, I can't even stand on my own
I saw water

I said I wanted to break my friends
But my dependency won't let me away
I'd like to think that I can work it out some
But I want to be put into the ground
Today, I needed a break
My friends are up in mountains and I'm drowning in lakes
I swallowed water right in front of her face
Just to show that she had nothing to say

I felt lighter
I impressed her

But my emotions ran unopposed
I felt just like Brian Jones
I've never felt that lost before
I just don't feel incredible

But me, well of course I liked you
Have time for me, I don't expect you to
I see me become a recluse
It's very easy to seclude

I saw water
I felt better

Well I woke up feeling embarrassed from
When I drowned in my swimming pool
You thought it was an accident
But I just can't get along with you

But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
I learned a lot about falling in love
When I fell out of love
I learned a lot about being a friend
When I was alone
Well, I played with fire
I burned it all down
Well, I've made more mistakes
Than you can count

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Well, I played with fire
I burned it all down
Well, I've made more mistakes
Than you can count

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Pushing me away because you feel that I'm all the same
Nothing that I do ever seems to make a change
Pushing me away because you feel that I'm all the same
Pushing me away because you're pushing me away

It's early and bright out
The sun swallowed me
I'm glad that you're here with me
This is where I want to be
This is where I want to be
The sun swallowed me

And what about your friends?
What about your friends, do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends, do they make you happy?

The sun swallowed me

And what about your friends?
What about your friends, do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends, do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends, do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your

Pull yourself down to get calm
The air in your chest beats the air that you're standing on
Relax yourself man, get calm
I've never seen her, so she must be no one
The girl that you found always gone
The air in your chest beats the air that you're standing on
Relax yourself man, get calm
I've never seen her
